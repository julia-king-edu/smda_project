Berlin, the capital of Germany, is a city of immense historical significance, vibrant culture, and a dynamic, ever-evolving identity.

The city's skyline is a striking blend of the historic and the contemporary. Iconic landmarks like the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag stand as powerful symbols of Germany's history and reunification, while the sleek architecture of Potsdamer Platz and the Berlin Hauptbahnhof represent its modernity.

Berlin's tumultuous past is evident in the remnants of the Berlin Wall, a somber reminder of the city's division. The East Side Gallery, covered in colorful murals, has transformed this symbol of separation into a vibrant artistic canvas.

The city's cultural scene is a testament to its creativity, with world-class museums like the Pergamon Museum and the Gemäldegalerie housing remarkable art collections. The Berlin Philharmonic and Berlin State Opera offer a rich cultural experience.

Berlin's nightlife is legendary, with a plethora of bars, clubs, and music venues that cater to every taste. The city's diverse culinary scene reflects its multicultural population, offering a wide range of international cuisines.

The Tiergarten and the city's many parks provide green escapes within the urban landscape, while the Mauerpark hosts a bustling flea market and open-air karaoke sessions.

Berlin's open and welcoming atmosphere, along with its commitment to sustainability and innovation, make it a city that thrives on diversity and change. It's a place where history and progress coexist, where creativity knows no bounds, and where the past is a constant reminder of the city's enduring spirit. Berlin invites all who visit to explore its historic landmarks, embrace its artistic treasures, and be part of its ever-evolving story.

BltqfdJtPnU,Kameror installeras i städer för klimatlockdowns. Här är vad de inte vill att du ska veta,"97 städer är med i detta experiment och en stad speciellt har röstat ner hela förslaget. Hela 93% människor rasar mot planerna och politikerna kör fulspel och censurerar protesterna. Det handlar om Agenda 2030 och klimatsmarta städer. Stockholm stad är med i listan och borgmästaren är till och med medlem i styrgruppen. 
Klimatfängelserna har kommit till Sverige.

127iFAxFu1U,Il Great Reset delle città,"“15-minute city”, ovvero la “città da 15 minuti”. È il progetto, proposto dall’urbanista franco-colombiano Carlos Moreno, docente alla Sorbona, e reso popolare nel 2020 dal sindaco di Parigi, Anne Hidalgo. L’idea è suggestiva: rendere le grandi città più vivibili, suddividendole in distretti al cui interno le persone troveranno tutto ciò “di cui hanno bisogno”. Il progetto si inserisce all’interno del più ambio concetto di “smart city”, la “città intelligente” del futuro nella quale la digitalizzazione e l’uso delle moderne tecnologie, dall’intelligenza artificiale alle ICT (Tecnologie dell’informazione e della comunicazione), creeranno le condizioni per ridurre gli spostamenti fisici delle persone. All’interno del proprio quartiere ci si potrà muovere a piedi, in bicicletta, con mezzi pubblici o, all’occorrenza, con mezzi elettrici in sharing. Gli spostamenti al di fuori del proprio distretto con mezzi privati non elettrici saranno sottoposti a monitoraggio, e possibili limitazioni. Il progetto è in fase di sperimentazione a Oxford, e ha sollevato forti proteste popolari: il limite massimo agli spostamenti è stato fissato a 100 uscite annuali dal proprio distretto, monitorate con telecamere e soggetto a sanzioni.
Il tema è: chi definisce ciò “di cui le persone hanno bisogno”, chi definisce i distretti e i limiti di spostamento? Non vi è il rischio che ciò che nasce come un diritto naturale diventi un “permesso”, concesso, modulato o ritirato a discrezione dell’autorità pubblica? Dai lockdown sanitari ai lockdown climatici? È presto per dirlo, ma preoccupa il giro mentale soggiacente a questi progetti, non a caso in forte accelerazione post-CoViD e oggetto di molte discussioni a Davos. Un motivo in più per preoccuparsi…

HXbwXzjDzck,Planning the Cycling City from the Netherlands to Ireland _ by Lana Salameh @Arup,"Thanks Arup, my colleagues from Ireland and across the European offices from the Transport Planning Skills Network for listening in to my presentation about my course Planning the Cycling City the other day. It was quite the pleasure to do and really encouraging to see how many people attended. The conversation must go on!

My presentation provided an overview of lessons learnt from leaders in the field of cycling cities, specifically from the Netherlands. With recent headlines like “If we all cycled like the Dutch, global emissions would drop nearly 700 million tonnes” (Euronews.com), there is no doubt Ireland’s efforts towards enhancing active travel comes to be of at most significance to curb emissions in the country. 

The presentation covered various topics that include urban cycling (historical and current trends), cycling infrastructure, land use, bicycle culture and effects, bikenomics… etc in hopes to give as much insight as possible to work towards those goals through our projects and Arup’s connections with local authorities.

An important thank you once again for the lecturers at the University of Amsterdam – Meredith Glaser, Ines Alveano-Aguerrebere, Lior Steinberg, Ruth Oldenziel, Luca Bertolini, Chris Bruntlett, Roland Kager, Marco te Brömmelstroet, Mama Agatha, Katherine VanHoose, Tina Harris, Mijksenaar, Decisio and for the opportunity to get warped into the world of cycling. 

Correction: The map of the speed limits in Amsterdam City is to be implemented in 2023/2024. The current speed limit of 30 km/h is the case on one of the circular roads around the city centre, on some central roads and other roads to the East of the city. (But it's being implemented soon on such a wide scale- hopefully other cities can take the lesson from it still)

dEodvwQJZbo,NYC and the 15-minute city concept,"The 15-minute city comes by many names: 20-minute city, 10-minute city, 15-minute village, complete neighborhood, or walkable neighborhood. But all these names point to one concept. The idea of a 15-minute city is one where a person can fulfill their basic needs within a walkable or bike-able distance — which is about 15-minutes. New York City is mostly made up of walkable neighborhoods. This video features an example of a one in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-Württemberg in Germany, is a city that effortlessly blends rich history, cutting-edge technology, and cultural sophistication.

The city's skyline is a fusion of historic and modern architecture. The Old Castle, with its medieval charm, and the New Castle, showcasing Baroque grandeur, are reminders of Stuttgart's royal past.

Stuttgart is a paradise for car enthusiasts, being the birthplace of the automobile. The Mercedes-Benz and Porsche Museums provide an immersive journey through automotive history.

Hold onto your seats as we delve into a mind-boggling narrative that questions the very nature of recent events. In this thought-provoking video, ""Unveiling Shocking Claims: Were Maui Wildfires Orchestrated for a 15-Minute City Transformation?"" we take a deep dive into astonishing allegations that have captured the imagination.

🌄 Wildfires as Catalysts: Could the devastating Maui wildfires have been more than just natural disasters? Join us as we explore the provocative idea that these events may have been orchestrated to accelerate the concept of 15-minute cities – a bold urban planning movement that aims to transform the way we live, work, and interact within our communities.

🌆 A Vision of Urban Transformation: Explore the fascinating concept of 15-minute cities, where essential services, workplaces, and recreational opportunities are within a 15-minute reach, reshaping our urban landscape and fostering sustainable, vibrant communities.

🤯 Open Dialogue: Our intention is not to dictate the truth, but to foster a space for open dialogue and exploration of unconventional ideas. Join the conversation by sharing your thoughts, opinions, and alternative perspectives in the comments section.

Prepare to have your perceptions challenged and your imagination ignited as we dive into the controversial notion surrounding Maui wildfires and their potential link to an urban transformation agenda. In a world where reality often surprises us, exploring alternative perspectives is an essential part of staying informed and engaged.


The fake Maui wildfires were orchestrated by the globalist elite to poison our air, water, and soil, and redistribute property into the hands of the elite, according to a World Economic Forum insider who warns that “Build back better” literally means destroying things first and then rebuilding according to New World Order plans.

The World Economic Forum is using Maui as Ground Zero to launch a devastating attack on the people, which has laid the groundwork for the rapid reconstruction of the island into 15 minute cities designed to lock down ordinary people in vast outdoor prisons from which there will be no escape.

This evil plan has been in the works for years, and now we are seeing it play out in all its grisly details before our very eyes.",True

He will also be telling us all about the Good Space, and how about it being more of a work club rather than a coworking space. And how working in a coworking space gave him the idea of founding the Good Space.

N2WhADwmxmQ,GROUP CHAT ROUND TABLE: The Pros/Cons of Bills 18/20,"Another wild week in Alberta politics, as Premier Danielle Smith's government introduces sweeping changes to how city and town councils are elected, operate, and are held accountable. The UCP's Bill 20 opens the door for municipal political parties, restores union and corporate donations, and empowers the province to remove elected councillors (when it's ""in the public interest""). Question is, are the changes good or bad for democracy? What do they mean for the average Albertan? Back by popular demand...it's our Group Chat Round Table! 

2:10 | Jenny Adams, Sarah Hamilton, and Jarrett Campbell take on municipal political parties (10:00), the return of union and corporate donations (26:05), the power to fire city councillors (29:00), Bill 18 - the Provincial Priorities Act (31:10), Pierre Poilievre's roadside photo op (34:00), and the Alberta NDP leadership race (48:30). 

57:00 | Gabriel sounds off on 15 Minute Cities, James is nervous about the feds selling TMX, and Angela has a message for Alberta's duly-elected mayors and councillors. It's The Flamethrower presented by the DQs of Northwest Edmonton and Sherwood Park!

Sunbeam wants to build a mixed-use community where residents can walk to work, restaurants and retail stores.
Plans include an overhaul of part of Kennedy Causeway, transforming it into a walkable urban center. There will be new retail stores and restaurants on both sides of Kennedy Causeway and along the length of the half-mile Island Walk, opening the bay to everyone.
Sunbeam Properties is transforming 13 acres in North Bay Village into a vibrant new mixed-use development. The proposed Sunbeam North Bay Village project will create 1,936 residential units, 6% being workforce housing, adding a hotel, new restaurants, a grocer, day care and additional retail opportunities that are committed to have 5% local merchants. WSVN will continue to operate a satellite studio within the project.
The project will have 1.25 acres of space open to the public, including a dog park and access to Biscayne Bay. In addition, a ferry is proposed as an alternative mode of transportation, unprecedented for North Bay Village residents.
The site is currently a television station, radio towers, an office building, vacant restaurants a small shopping center and parking.

The city walls or restrictions or zones or whatever you want to call them won't be used to keep others out, they'll be used to lock everyone in""... Comment:

In the context of the ""15-minute city"" regeneration projects, the use of intelligence frameworks like ASCOPE and PMESII introduces both immense potential and potential risks. These frameworks, traditionally employed in military and intelligence contexts, are now finding relevance in urban planning and security. As governments and intelligence agencies seek to understand the operational environment and gather critical information, it becomes crucial to assess how such knowledge can be misused and pose serious threats to the 15 Minute City concept.

Imagine the intricate web of a 15 Minute City, where every service, infrastructure, and organization is interconnected to provide residents with accessible and sustainable urban living. While this vision is undoubtedly transformative, it opens the door to malevolent actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise the city's integrity. Espionage by enemy nations, terrorist groups, or unethical entities could easily leverage ASCOPE and PMESII to identify crucial weak points, leading to the disruption and sabotage of critical services within the city.

The consequences of such compromises are dire and extend beyond just inconvenience. The fabric of society, transportation, healthcare, utilities, and information networks could be targeted, creating a domino effect of chaos and instability. Our dream of a harmonious 15 Minute City could turn into a nightmare if not adequately safeguarded against these emerging threats.

To preserve the integrity and vision of the 15 Minute City, proactive measures must be taken to mitigate the risks associated with ASCOPE and PMESII operations. Comprehensive risk assessments become paramount in identifying potential vulnerabilities unique to this urban context. This analysis should encompass not only physical aspects but also the ever-evolving cyber realm, where protecting critical digital infrastructure is of utmost importance.

Robust cybersecurity measures must be established, incorporating advanced encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. These digital fortifications form the front line in safeguarding against cyberattacks that could cripple essential systems within the city.

Enhanced surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities are indispensable tools in detecting and deterring suspicious activities. Utilizing advanced technologies such as video monitoring, biometrics, and data analytics can provide invaluable insights into potential threats within the city. Collaboration with intelligence agencies is crucial, as exchanging information can ensure real-time updates and vigilance against emerging risks.

Public awareness and education are equally vital in creating a resilient 15 Minute City. Instilling a culture of awareness among citizens and key stakeholders can encourage reporting of suspicious activities, thus forming a collective defense against potential threats. Implementing training programs and promoting responsible digital practices can minimize vulnerabilities and foster a united front against any malicious intent.

Moreover, addressing the complexity of the 15 Minute City requires a multidisciplinary approach. Government agencies, private sector entities, and research institutions must join forces to tackle security challenges collectively. Information sharing, conducting joint exercises, and leveraging diverse expertise can lead to the development of comprehensive security strategies, reinforcing the city's resilience against potential threats.

In conclusion, the realization of the 15 Minute City is a vision worth pursuing, offering the promise of sustainable and livable urban environments for all. However, we must confront the reality of potential risks posed by ASCOPE and PMESII operations. By embracing a proactive and multidimensional approach, we can ensure the safety and longevity of the 15 Minute City concept. Let us work together to preserve the vision of the World Economic Forum and create a future where accessible and efficient urban living flourishes, resilient against any adversary seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for their own gain.",False

Iqa4ZCVXNGY,15 Minute Smart Cities Are Here   - Jordan Peterson (Support Video),"In this video, Jordan Peterson explores the concept of 15-minute cities and their potential implications for society. Peterson discusses how Google attempted to collude with the Ontario government to turn Toronto's New Port development into a smart city and the concerns around the data generated by constant monitoring. He also talks about the 15-minute city plan proposed by the C40 consortium of municipalities, which aims to reduce caloric consumption and limit travel outside of neighborhoods, and the potential for top-down surveillance systems in places like China. Peterson also discusses the concept of smart cities and the concerns around complete control and the loss of privacy. The video includes personal anecdotes from Peterson's travels in China and his observations of the implementation of smart city technology there. Overall, the video provides a critical examination of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the 15-minute city and smart city concepts.

ctxeBfWWDbM,15-minute cities - Using GIS to understand local accessibility,"Locally focused and sustainable models for planning cities have been increasing in popularity, such as the 15-minute city. With planners keen to embrace this model, Steer has developed a spatial analysis method to determine local accessibility as a measure of a defining 15-minute city, while also considering some of the local challenges and opportunities an area may experience. Oli will provide an overview of the method and apply it to London and other locations throughout the UK.

📝 Transcripción del video: 
En un mundo cada vez más urbanizado, las ciudades enfrentan desafíos crecientes relacionados con la movilidad, la sostenibilidad y la calidad de vida de sus habitantes. En este sentido, una propuesta innovadora que ha ganado tracción es el concepto de ""Ciudades de 15 minutos"". 
Este concepto fue desarrollado por el urbanista francocolombiano Carlos Moreno y busca transformar la manera en que vivimos, reorganizando las áreas urbanas para que los residentes accedan a todos los servicios y comodidades esenciales a una distancia de 15 minutos a pie o en bicicleta desde su hogar. La idea es diseñar ciudades que requieran menor uso de automóviles, donde las personas pasen menos tiempo en el tráfico y caminar o andar en bici sea mucho más conveniente.
No obstante, esta propuesta disruptiva ha encontrado resistencia por parte de algunas personas que aseguran que es parte de una conspiración, un plan secreto de control social que busca confinarnos y limitar nuestras libertades, pese a que la idea de las ciudades de 15 minutos es precisamente dar más tiempo y mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas.

A serious look at Edmonton's 15 minute city plan and latest meeting about it.
 Is this the future we want? Will fifteen minute communities make the standard of living worse in Canadian cities? How much freedom will be restricted?
Part of this video discusses the policy documents laying out the plan for 15 minute community in Edmonton, as well as a recent urban planning committee with participation from the public. The plan has ""districts,"" reduction in car use, densely-packed buildings in designated ""nodes and corridors"", etc.",True

Calgary, situated in the picturesque province of Alberta, Canada, is a city that combines the rugged beauty of the Canadian Rockies with a vibrant urban spirit.

The city's skyline is dominated by the iconic Calgary Tower, offering panoramic views of the city and the nearby foothills. Downtown, you'll find a mix of modern architecture, historic buildings, and bustling streets.

Calgary's Western heritage is celebrated annually during the Calgary Stampede, known as the ""Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth."" This rodeo and exhibition is a spectacle of cowboy culture, with thrilling rodeo events and lively parades.

The city's commitment to the arts is evident in the Glenbow Museum and the Arts Commons, which host exhibitions, performances, and cultural events year-round.

Calgary is a gateway to the stunning landscapes of Banff and Jasper National Parks, where you can explore pristine lakes, hike through mountain trails, and encounter abundant wildlife.

The 15 min City is an instance of the whatif-machine platform, based on the “15 minutes city” concept proposed by Carlos Moreno.

The Gold Coast, located on Australia's east coast in Queensland, is a sun-kissed paradise that combines stunning natural beauty with a vibrant urban lifestyle.
Miles of golden sandy beaches stretch along the coastline, including the iconic Surfers Paradise Beach, where you can soak up the sun, surf the waves, or enjoy a beachfront stroll.
The city is renowned for its skyline adorned with modern skyscrapers, but it's the lush hinterland that adds a touch of enchantment. The Gold Coast Hinterland, with its national parks and waterfalls, offers opportunities for hiking, wildlife encounters, and breathtaking views.
Theme parks like Dreamworld, Movie World, and Sea World provide thrilling adventures for visitors of all ages, while the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary offers a chance to get up close and personal with Australia's unique wildlife.
The Gold Coast's culinary scene is diverse and delicious, with waterfront dining, fresh seafood, and international cuisine.

LYRICS:
What’s in your heads in those test beds? any reality getting through?
Or are you stuck in a daze where they’re A OK, those plans in place for you?
well pretty soon the truth’s gotta hit you, a bolt out of the blue
Will you ask yourself will you wonder, why did we all not warn you?

They’ve been so slow and gradual, so patient training you
They numbed ya and they’ve dumbed ya down, some part of you knows that’s true
Do you care what’s in that contract between the state and you?
While they lock you up and tie you down, why do you let them blindfold you?

Low impact compact living, looks like what’s in store for you
All they say you need it’ll all be there, all laid out for you
Energy and travel only essentials now for you
You don’t have nowhere else you need to be, do you??

Chorus
15 minute city
15 minute life
All that you need within it
What’s not to like?

15 minute city
squeezing your life so tight.
Let’s call it what it is:
You‘ll be in prison, serving life

Verse 2

They spooked you perfectly with their spoof emergency
got to prevent catastrophe, that's their so familiar plea
now the future rests on you good slave, your compliance will be the key
They say you’ll save mother earth and you’ll save humanity

They sell your cage it like it’s so cool, a place you’ll wanna be
fresher air with no pollution, open spaces, greenery,
and the things you’ve hungered so much for they’ll tell you that there’ll be
human closeness and cohesion of something called community,

Your CBDC balance will update incessantly
only grows when you show how submissive you can be -
Passes out they are a privilege, and issued sparingly
They can’t permit you inmates to keep dreaming that you’re free

Chorus 2

15 minute city,
They promise you you’ll like
15 minute city
Your high tech open prison life
15 minute city
You might think it sounds all right
15 minute city
All your rights revoked - it's for the planet, and wildlife

(GUITAR SOLO)

Your keepers they don’t care at all, if you take a view
Just you be grateful, that they pretend, that they’re consulting you
smiling kindly while trapping you, in the eco-zoo
One cup of bugs per day, unless you’ve earned the points for two

Final chorus

15 minute city, 15 minute life
15 minute city, 15 minute life

15 minute city
They count on you to welcome it, not put up any fight
15 minute city
For the planet, You know it’s only right
15 minute city
Shrink that footprint so tight
15 minute city
Your future’s not so bright
15 minute city
looking dark, darker, than shite
15 minute city
Agenda 2030, unfolding in plain sight

So, as you might imagine, this song is about 15 minute cities.

Fk4ce7l1a_U,15-Minute Cities: Climate-Lockdown Dystopias?,"15-minute cities are a concept that have gained popularity around the world as mayors and city councils try to cut down on the amount of fossil fuels used by city residents. The idea is to have all necessities within a 15-minute commute of a person's home, which would cut down on the need to drive long distances on a daily basis. Sounds great, right? Well, let's just say it's not as rosy as it sounds.

Ghost towns are coming that you won't want to walk down let alone live in.
Debbie also promotes the protest going on in Oxford against 15 minte cities. It's this saturday 18th and I'll be streaming there from 1pm so long as Oxford's new traffic problems allow my lift to get me there on time!!!  We'll see.  Speakers include Debbie and Mark Devlin.

Watch the Nebula exclusive, Great Cities: Central Park: https://nebula.tv/videos/citybeautiful-the-brilliant-design-of-new-yorks-central-park?ref=citynerd

If you're anything like me, you're already tired of how the ""15-minute city"" idea has been co-opted into the culture wars. It's really this simple: all things being equal, having more stuff that you need and want on a day-to-day basis within a reasonable walking distance is better than not having it. I suppose whatever argument there is is over what ""all things being equal"" consists of.

Today I take you on a tour of Valencia, Spain, and talk about how Valencians enjoy something more like a 5-minute city, probably without thinking about it (or even considering it argument-worthy) at all. Hope you enjoy!

In the United States, cities including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Cleveland are putting a spin on the concept of 15 minute cities. The 15-minute city is an urban planning concept that, as its name suggests, aims to create communities where people can access key amenities by travelling no more than 15 minutes on foot or by bike. As of march 2023 There are already 16 cities worldwide that have implemented the 15-minute city concept or similar ideas. those who are trying to implement this is concerned about combating climate change.
Lowering the emission, pollution and to become much more greener are the concerns of creating 15 minute cities.

Can 15 minute cities work in the US properly? Lately this topic is getting a lot of pushback due to the conspiracy of the 15 minute cities. Some think it is a way to keep the masses self contained by limiting our ability to travel and go places via vehicles. With more and more restriction comes into play regarding traveling. These 15 minute cities will start serving it purpose. The 15-minute city scheme is designed to have your amenities within walking distance and we are talking about medical, food supply, schooling just to name a few. But what if you have to travel outside your city to another grocery store or to go to work how about schooling. As of now everything is all over the place. As i have mentioned there are 15 minuet cities already in effect in other countries but when if fully get up and running in the US it's going to be some trouble.",False

The Big Idea: What makes a city beautiful, livable, walkable, and simply a desirable place to call home? And on the other side, what mistakes can destroy a city’s appeal to residents, visitors, and investors? For the last six years, Cal Poly Assistant Professor of City and Regional Planning Dave Amos has been exploring answers to these questions through his hugely popular YouTube channel, City Beautiful. The channel embraces a mantra: that cities are amazing, and then seeks to understand what makes some cities succeed while others stumble. 

The Experts:  Dave Amos, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of City and Regional Planning, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Creator & Producer, City Beautiful, YouTube channel and Manuel Santana Palacios, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of City and Regional Planning, The Knowlton School of Architecture, The Ohio State University, with host Belkis Schoenhals, Principal Planner, The City of Columbus",False

82MnIuJvCzo,"No, 15-Minute Cities Will Not Take Away Your Freedom (And The Conspiracies Are WRONG!!!)","""But, but where am I gonna perk my ker? it's just an excuse to control us! It's Communism!!!""

15-minute cities, or just simply cities is something that existed since well, the beginning cities. They were places that were within a 15-minute walkable distance. And the United States of America had one of the most walkable cities in the world along with the most exquisite chef's kiss like public transit. that all changed after World War II, where the automobile started becoming the center of transportation. it seemed good at first, but now it has caused so many problems, like financial problems, problems with emotional and physical health, etc.

It seems like it's a foreign concept for Americans that they think putting things that close to each other, like stores, parks, housing, etc., close together is... just simply not American. well, one example I mentioned is in Oxford, UK, but still. it seems that the automobile has consumed most of our lifestyles, and that's not good. it's not our fault either. with generations of car lobbying, I'm sure I would've been like that too!

But yeah, it's basically just making cities more walkable, and although conspiracy theories have been on the rise (along with every stupid conspiracy theory since post-COVID), I can kind of see where they are coming from since I think they're setting up road filters throughout the City of Oxford. I think it's just better to build things close together, and upzone. those are better alternatives than just, adding road filters, cameras, etc. like if you really don't want people going through there, just block it off. 

but yeah, enjoy the video from an urban planner, that's not an urban planner.

(correction): I think there was 5 areas in oxford for the 15-minute city plan, I think the center one was like the city center. I don't know if that matters, but yeah, you get the whole jist.

Melanie Lowe of the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia discusses her article, ""A Pathway to Prioritizing and Delivering Healthy and Sustainable Cities,"" co-authored with James F. Sallis, Deborah Salvo, Ester Cerin, Geoff Boeing, Carl Higgs, Shiqin Liu, Erica Hinckson, Deepti Adlakha, Jonathan Arundel, Anne Vernez Moudon, Eugen Resendiz, Billie Giles-Corti; published in Journal of City Climate Policy Volume 1 Number 1, October 2022.
 
Creating healthy and sustainable cities should be a global priority. Some cities prioritize 15-minute cities as a planning approach with co-benefits for health, climate change mitigation, equity, and economic recovery from COVID-19. Yet, as our recent Lancet Global Health series on “Urban Design, Transport, and Health” showed, many cities have a long way to go to achieve this vision. This policy guideline summarizes the main findings of the series, which assessed health and sustainability indicators for 25 cities in 19 countries. We then outline steps governments can take to strengthen policy frameworks and deliver more healthy, equitable, and sustainable built environments. 
 
The Lancet Global Health series provided clear evidence that cities need to transform urban governance to enable integrated planning for health and sustainability and commit to policy implementation. Evidence-informed indicators should be used to benchmark and monitor progress. Cities need policy frameworks that are comprehensive and consistent with evidence, with measurable policy targets to support implementation and accountability. The series provided evidence-informed thresholds for some key urban design and transport features, which can be embedded as policy targets. Policies and interventions must prioritize identifying and reducing inequities in access to health-supportive environments. Governments should also invest in open data and promote citizen-science programmes, to support indicator development and research for public benefit. We provide tools to replicate our indicators and an invitation to join our 1000 Cities Challenge via the Global Observatory of Healthy and Sustainable Cities.",False

I show you how to take your suburban neighborhood and turn into a pedestrian utopia! Making your city walkable can help a ton with reducing traffic. Road diets, bike lanes, public transport and adding in parks, schools and city services goes a long way in creating communities that are actually happy places for our citizen to live. I hope you will join me next time as I continue to use the concept of a 15-Minute City as a framework for building the city of Mordalgo in Cities Skylines!

Lucerne, a picturesque city in the heart of Switzerland, is a place where stunning natural beauty, rich history, and cultural vibrancy converge to create a truly enchanting experience.
The city's skyline is dominated by the iconic Kapellbrücke, a medieval wooden bridge adorned with a tower, and the Musegg Wall, which provides a glimpse into the city's medieval past.
Lucerne is beautifully situated on the shores of Lake Lucerne and surrounded by the breathtaking Swiss Alps. The city is a gateway to numerous outdoor adventures, including hiking, skiing, and boat trips on the lake.
The city's Old Town, with its cobblestone streets and colorful frescoed houses, exudes a timeless charm. The Lion Monument, a poignant sculpture carved into a rock face, pays homage to the Swiss Guards who served in the French Revolution.
Lucerne is a cultural hub, with institutions like the Rosengart Collection, housing works by Pablo Picasso, and the KKL Luzern, a modern concert hall known for its impressive acoustics.
The city's culinary scene offers Swiss specialties, including cheese fondue and raclette, as well as international flavors to please all palates.
Lucerne's warm and welcoming atmosphere, coupled with its stunning natural surroundings, make it a city that feels like a true Swiss paradise. It's a place where history meets nature, where culture thrives, and where the beauty of the landscape is a constant source of inspiration.

C1HCc75o7hc,HEROIC SPEECH TO CITY COUNCIL ON 15 MINUTE CITIES DRAWS STANDING OVATION!,"On Sept 20, 2023, Joel Sussman, delivered a brilliant speech to the city council of Aurora, Ontario, regarding the 1992 Canadian sellout to the UN, & today's current issue of 15 minute cities, by then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Mr Sussman's speech left the council members baffled, while drawing a rousing standing ovation from those in attendance. Joel, & his wife Margaret continue their incredible freedom fighting, & have successfully given this subject the spotlight it deserves. All of this was done under the lie of climate change & going green. All the usual suspects are involved in this New World Agenda...United Nations, World Health Organization, Council of Foreign Relations, G7, G20. In essence, all cities of the world are controlled by non-elected, non governmental agencies. Rosa Koire of Santa Clara, California is the one who started this fight, & her book ""Behind The Green Mask"", laid the foundation for the Sussman's work. Sadly, Rosa Koire passed on to her next incarnation last year under suspicious circumstances.",True

occ6BJqhbMc,"The Great Reset Conspiracy, Explained","Does the World Economic Forum want you to eat bugs? Are walkable cities part of a secret plan to trap us in our neighborhoods?  Are Klaus Schwab and his global elite friends plotting a ""Great Reset"" to control your life? 

No. (I mean billionaires still shouldn't exist but not because they want to make you eat bugs) 

The Great Reset conspiracy theory is just the next in a line of conspiracy theories that teach people to interpret all attempts to address climate change, no matter how toothless or greenwashed, as part of a larger plan to subjugate humanity under an eco-totalitarian regime. 

It's a strategy that has been used by Fox News, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk,  Glenn Beck, and other friends of fossil fuel companies. 

The end goal of this strategy is to hijack our discourse and make it impossible to talk about environmental policy in a rational way.

76NXpp7lH-o,Integrating Technology in Smart City Projects: A Semiotic Approach,"“Integrating Technology in Smart City Projects: A Semiotic Approach”
By Federico Bellentani 

Abstract:

In 1980, 39% of the global population, resided in cities. By 2015, this number had surged to 54% and projections indicate it will reach 66% by 2050. As cities expand and evolve, the push of technology plays a pivotal role in shaping urban life. However, the rapid integration of technology into urban environments often overlooks the nuanced meanings and interpretations of city dwellers. 

This presentation introduces a semiotic methodology for embedding technology in smart city projects, focusing on the significance of people’s meanings and interpretations. By leveraging urban semiotics, it proposes a human-centered approach to smart city development that harmonizes technological advancements with the cultural and social fabric of urban populations. 

This semiotic framework advocates for a participatory process where technological solutions are not merely imposed but are thoughtfully integrated based on the local contexts, values and practices of urban communities. This approach aims to enhance human experiences, foster inclusive and sustainable communities and ensure that technological progress supports human well-being and agency. 

This presentation will contribute to an extended theoretical toolkit for studying cities as semiotic entities, considering also the contributions included in the edited book Semiotics approaches to urban space (by Bellentani, Panico & Yoka, Edward Elgar Publishing),and provide practical suggestions for integrating technology in ways that enhance the lived experiences of urban populations.

DJVLWPyXXvk,Was The Village The First 15 Minute City? | The Prisoner Puzzle,"Was The Village The First 15 Minute City? It is a question, not a statement. The Prisoner Puzzle, was filmed in 1977 with host, Warner Troyer. The Ontario Educational Communications Authority published this interview. The Prisoner was a 17 part series first shown in 1967 through to 1968. Published by ITC/ITV, over 17 million viewers tuned in to watch each episode. It featured one man's quest to retain his individuality in an enclosed village. Both literal and allegorical, the deep and dark series confused many on its release and has become one of the most popular shows ever broadcast. Often copied, parodied and even used in Iron Maiden's song, The Prisoner. The Prisoner series is available to buy as a DVD collection or through television download channels.

8KkWd8hf9X8,Dubai launches the concept of a '20-minute city' where residents can reach destinations within 20min,"Dubai unveils the concept of a '20-minute city'.
Residents will be able to travel to destinations within 20 minutes by foot or bicycle.
The initiative intends to beautify urban areas and reduce the carbon footprint.
The 20-minute city will be divided into four centres - sector centre, district centre, community centre, and neighbourhood centre. 
Each sector will feature different amenities such as a co-working hub, shopping centre, hospital, smart police station, school etcetera.
About 55 per cent of the residents will be placed within 800 meters of mass transit stations.
High-density areas will have connected pathways for pedestrians and soft mobility. 
The project is part of the Dubai 2040 Urban Masterplan by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai.

jcW_qGkPbLU,Echoes of the Valley - Driving Change,"About the episode: From the historic battles waged along the banks of the River Valley to the visionary aspirations of the 15-minute community movement, it becomes apparent that the true power to effect change lies not solely in the hands of policymakers and institutions but rather in the collective will of the people.

About the podcast: Echoes of the Valley explores the intricate relationship between transportation, the environment, and the profound influence of two periods and two communities in Edmonton, Alberta's capital city. Cohosts Eylse Colville and Emily Homeniuk examine the historical significance of Edmonton's North Saskatchewan River Valley, the challenges it faced during late 1960s, and the activists who worked to protect the valley. Building on this historical backdrop, Colville and Homeniuk discuss the contemporary 15-minute community movement and the push-back this neighbourhood model received.

Louis encourages viewers to do their own research and stay informed about the forces shaping our cities and societies.

-5qbrSjkw30,Cidade de 15 minutos,"Imagine poder viver, trabalhar, estudar e dispor de serviços essenciais para a nossa qualidade de vida a apenas 15 minutos de casa, a pé ou de bicicleta. 
Este conceito já é praticado em algumas cidades do mundo, e tem ganhado cada vez mais destaque desde que a pandemia do coronavírus acelerou a popularização do home office e fez com que as pessoas evitassem deslocamentos em massa para lugares distantes. 
Conhecida como “Cidade de 15 minutos” ou “Cidade de um quarto de hora”, a proposta promove o planejamento urbano no nível do bairro, desincentivando a circulação de carros – e, consequentemente, a poluição causada pelo trânsito desenfreado das cidades -, descentralizando serviços e tornando a vida possível sem a necessidade de grandes deslocamentos. 
Raquel Cardamone, CEO da Bright Cities falou sobre o assunto junto com o super especialista em urbanismo Philip Yang da URBEM.

In this gripping episode, a labyrinth of enigmatic themes is explored, unraveling a web of intrigue. The journey commences with a tantalizing glance into the world of Carbon Tax as a purported solution. As the curtain lifts, the shadowy landscape of ""15-minute cities"" is unveiled, beckoning us to question their true purpose. Veering further into the depths, the concept of a ""Walk Score"" introduces an element of surveillance within the urban fabric.

Yet, the puzzle takes a darker turn as the enigma of owning nothing for happiness is dissected, raising suspicions of orchestrated control. Amidst the whispers, a chilling revelation surfaces: is human intelligence truly ascending or is a veiled force manipulating perceptions? The ethereal allure of ""15-minute cities"" is juxtaposed with unsettling questions: who are the architects, and what clandestine motives fuel this construct?

Within this enigmatic theater, the entanglement of Fitbit and alleged China spying tales beckons, unveiling the cloak-and-dagger nature of modern surveillance. As the narrative unfolds, the inquiry deepens into the psyche of the modern narcissist, echoing with the resonance of obscured agendas.

The exploration veers toward the arcane as the World Economic Forum's assertion on suburbs and health is contemplated, casting a shadow of doubt on the intentions behind their claims. In the midst of this tapestry, the concept of dissentive emerges—a manipulative orchestration of behavior.

Venturing further, the unsettling revelation emerges that ""15-minute cities"" may already be surreptitiously at play, concealing hidden designs. A figure emerges from the shadows, Josh Green, offering glimpses of a 15-minute city near Lahaina—begging us to contemplate the unseen orchestrations.

As the puzzle pieces align, the enigma deepens with Andre Cadorette's revelations on the Great Reset, echoing with whispers of a covert agenda. The mystique of personal transformation beckons, hinting at the undercurrents of empowerment in uncertain times. In the same breath, Christina Anderson's insights cast a spotlight on the intersection of ""15-minute cities"" and Climate Change lockdowns, evoking a sense of controlled destiny.

The climax emerges as a disconcerting dialogue explores the potential diabolic programming of the young, ushering the audience into a realm of disquieting possibilities. In this clandestine theater, the threads of perceived truth unravel, revealing an intricate tapestry of orchestrated narratives that leaves the audience pondering, questioning, and delving into the abyss of the unknown.
