1pUMO3QgpI8,0,2022-04-10,Making Cleveland a 15-minute city: Experts say it's a real possibility,"Imagine a Cleveland where everything you need is less than 15 minutes away.

Mayor Justin Bibb says Cleveland wants to be the first 15-minute city in North America, introducing the concept during his State of the City speech Wednesday. The urban planning model is not brand new; it first took off in Paris, but has gained in popularity during the pandemic.

""The basic concept of a 15-minute city is this ideal planning framework where human needs and desires are accessible within a 15-minute walk, bicycle ride, or transit trip,"" Matt Moss, a planner with Cleveland City Planning Commission, explained. ""That's really what we're striving for in this new planning model.""

Instead of a concrete jungle where people work and separate places where people live, in a so-called 15-minute city, everything is closer. Moss says it doesn't have to be a dream.

""It's starting out with the city we have now,"" he said, ""and then asking residents how they might want their community to grow or change in ways that, again, make things accessible or provide them with more opportunities to access the things they want to get to in their day to day lives.""

Sara Shookman reports: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/cleveland-15-minute-city/95-78d510ca-0b51-4b4b-bdff-7562aef49f22",12530,making cleveland 15 minute city expert say real possibility imagine cleveland everything need le 15 minute away mayor justin bibb say cleveland want first 15 minute city north america introducing concept state city speech wednesday urban planning model brand new first took paris ha gained popularity pandemic basic concept 15 minute city ideal planning framework human need desire accessible within 15 minute walk bicycle ride transit trip matt moss planner cleveland city planning commission explained really striving new planning model instead concrete jungle people work separate place people live called 15 minute city everything closer moss say dream starting city said asking resident might want community grow change way make thing accessible provide opportunity access thing want get day day life sara shookman report,149.0,268,False,

6ulduV7tBnM,0,2022-04-10,Cleveland mayor Justin Bibb wants to make Cleveland a 15-minute city,"Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb marked his first 100 days in office by delivering the State of the City address Wednesday night.

The speech took place in Silver Hall at the Maltz Performing Arts Center at Case Western Reserve University, where Bibb attended law school. Hundreds of business and civic leaders, public officials, and residents were in attendance.

""We said that 'Cleveland can't wait,' and we meant it"" Bibb said, echoing his famous campaign slogan. ""Cleveland, the wait for change is over.""

In his remarks, the mayor listed progresses attacking the lead poisoning crisis and the pandemic, pushing police reforms, and passing an ambitious budget, albeit one that relies on federal money. He also took credit for launching new conversations around the waterfront development.

""Irishtown Bend,"" he declared, ""and finally, finally exploring the future of Burke Lakefront Airport as well, too.""

Bibb said safety remains his top priority, and noted how his tenure has been shaped by death of police officer Shane Bartek, who was killed during a carjacking 48 hours before Bibb took office.

MiiriQxoMiM,0,2022-05-01,In-demand Amenities and the 15-minute City for the Suburbs,"Our President and Founder, Wendy Spreenberg, discusses the trend toward including Content Studios in corporate offices and the emergence of municipalities considering the 15-minute City concept: live/work/play within a 15-minute walk. Based on how the pandemic accelerated our behaviors, the 15-minute city concept becomes more relevant for creating more vibrant suburban downtowns.
_________________________________
TRANSCRIPT:
(The amenities in demand) I think that we're also recommending. So as part of our plans with our clients, we're considering creating these flexible workspaces is that Creative Studio, the Content Studio, whether it's podcasting, whether it's video casting, whether it's literally e-commerce, you'll take a photo of your product, your product, those green screens, with a white background itself is something that is being incorporated into offices, let alone coworking, more and more. The other thing that I wanted to mention as well, is that what what certainly Somerset and Ralph have developed here is what we've seen municipalities approach us on to do something about 15-minute City concept. So those of you who probably very familiar with that, where live/work/play is within a 15 minute distance, so that you can get all of your needs and all of your life cycle met So that's what we're seeing as well. So suburban downtowns, they're trying to revitalize as well and they're reaching out to us to see what it is that we can do to contribute to create the downtown suburban location as a destination again. And part of that is creating a flex opportunity then becomes Event Space plus Cafe plus retail that may not be in downtown anymore, but very much a visible vibrant community that you see here, as well.

In discussing these urban approaches, we often talk about what makes up these neighborhoods, like places for social interaction, playground for children, close proximity to primary life facilities and work, safe streets, green spaces, and easy access to transportation, all within the reach of a certain amount of minutes by foot, car or public transit.
So, we have identified that we need to achieve such environments inclusive of these needs. But how do we get there?

YJpClwGqMeY,0,2022-05-22,"Suburbs vs downtown in a cycling and pedestrian test of the ""15-minute city""","The transformation of the city of Paris under Mayor Anne Hidalgo has popularized the notion of the 15-minute city ‚Äî the idea that everything you need for your life should be within a 15-minute walk or bike ride of your home. As this idea has become an aspiration for many cities, I've often wondered what such neighbourhoods might look like. 

So I decided to do a kind of entry-level 15-minute city test to see just what living in one might be like. So I took three different neighbourhoods ‚Äî an urban downtown, a mixed-use urban community, and a suburb ‚Äî and ran a few tests to see if they might qualify as 15-minute cities. The answers just might give you some insight into how our cities can develop in the future.

After 5 years in SMEs and multinational companies he decided to follow his entrepreneurial dreams and he founded The Concept, a small Real Estate agency, growing brick by brick into one of the leading companies in Real Estate services in Romania.

Here's a clip my son shot of me walking, talking, eating, and pondering the place where God has staked His name.
Come with me for a 15-minute walk through Old City Jerusalem!
I am currently taking an amazing group of students on a weekly study through the Gospels using this city and the entire Holy Land as our classroom. Details are below, but a quick link is here: 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVK6dN-9kLDnQhYBFuES09A/join

The most mentioned place in the Bible is Jerusalem which shows up over 800 times in God's Word. 
Jerusalem is BIG in God‚Äôs Word

The most mentioned place in the Bible is a city called Jerusalem.

The center of the world and the prophetic universe is the same city.

Jerusalem should be your favorite city. After all, it‚Äôs the city that God has chosen for Himself.

1 Kings 11:13 (NKJV)  However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.‚Äù

Ancient maps put Jerusalem In the center of the world, and I think they were right.

Jerusalem is also God‚Äôs timepiece.

The final events of world history will culminate there with the glorious return of Jesus Christ to the Mount of Olives.

Jerusalem is God‚Äôs Countdown Clock for Humanity‚Äôs Survival

VLUY3UbufW8,0,2022-08-28,CIDADE 15 MINUTOS,"O conceito de cidade de 15 minutos √© um modelo de planejamento urbano descentralizado, no qual cada bairro local cont√©m todas as fun√ß√µes b√°sicas para viver e trabalhar. 
Muitas pessoas argumentam que o conceito de criar bairros localizados nos quais os moradores possam obter tudo o que precisam em 15 minutos a p√©, de bicicleta ou de transporte p√∫blico melhorar√° a qualidade de vida. 
Esses espa√ßos envolvem bairros polivalentes em vez de zonas espec√≠ficas para trabalhar, viver e entreter, reduzindo a necessidade de viagens desnecess√°rias, fortalecendo o senso de comunidade e melhorando a sustentabilidade e a habitabilidade.
Hoje, a maioria das cidades tem bairros ‚Äúcom usos espec√≠ficos‚Äù, com √°reas separadas usadas predominantemente para trabalho ou entretenimento; e o planejamento urbano setorizado resulta em uma expans√£o, com as pessoas tendo que percorrer longas dist√¢ncias pela cidade para chegar ao seu destino. 
Em contraste, as cidades compactas do futuro, ou ‚Äúhiperlocaliza√ß√£o‚Äù, priorizam estrat√©gias de infraestrutura urbana que visam trazer todos os elementos para viver e trabalhar nas comunidades locais.
A cidade de '15 minutos' √© uma itera√ß√£o da ideia de 'unidades de bairro' desenvolvida pelo planejador americano Clarence Perry durante a d√©cada de 1920. A teoria do ‚Äúnovo urbanismo‚Äù, um conceito de planejamento e design urbano que promove cidades caminh√°veis, ganhou popularidade na d√©cada de 1980. 

Por que essa ideia √© relevante para as cidades e seus cidad√£os?

Prote√ß√£o ambiental e sustentabilidade aprimoradas

Abrindo o caminho para moradias populares

Resili√™ncia aprimorada por meio de bairros com v√°rios usos

Onde?
Paris, Fran√ßa

Portland, EUA

Estocolmo, Su√©cia

Conceito √© ""passo para o futuro"": O modelo de rezoneamento ganhar√° mais for√ßa no futuro, impulsionado durante a pandemia de COVID-19 por novas formas de trabalho que exigem menos transporte. Com a mudan√ßa clim√°tica como uma grande preocupa√ß√£o global, a C40 recomendou esse modelo para cidades em todo o mundo, argumentando que sua abordagem de pedestres contribui para a redu√ß√£o das emiss√µes de gases de efeito estufa e apoia a sustentabilidade ambiental.

Instead of adding more streets to accommodate cars, a growing movement is pushing to ban them in dense areas like New York City. This would give more space for bike lanes, bus routes and pedestrian plazas while also reducing noise and air pollution.

Mai im Berliner Kino International, diskutierten Architekten und Baudezernentinnen mit Investoren und Stadtplanerinnen die 15-Minuten-Stadt. Die Frage der zweit√§gigen Veranstaltung: Wie lassen sich Infrastruktur und Architektur, Freiraumbeziehungen und Circular City Konzepte, neues Wohnen und alternative Mobilit√§t so verkn√ºpfen, dass die qualitative Unterscheidung zwischen Stadt und Land √ºberfl√ºssig wird?

Wie nie zuvor haben sich in den letzten Jahren die Anforderungen an unsere St√§dte ver√§ndert. Das Auto verschwand zeitweise von der Stra√üe. Die Arbeit r√ºckte vom B√ºro ins Wohnzimmer. Der √∂ffentliche Raum mutierte zum Urlaubsort. Der gr√∂√üte Umbruch fand zuhause statt: die eigene Wohnung und mit ihr die Architektur m√ºssen viel mehr leisten als zuvor.

Der Begriff der 15-Minuten-Stadt steht f√ºr eine architektonische und urbane Transformation, in der die Dinge des t√§glichen Lebens wieder handgreiflich in die Reichweite der Bewohner ger√ºckt werden. N√§he und Fernbeziehungen sind infrage gestellt die Digitalisierung wird zu einem Schl√ºssel der r√§umlichen Neuordnung. Das vertraute Gef√ºhl von Heimat, das man bisher nur dem Dorf zuschrieb, darf nicht fehlen.

HXbwXzjDzck,0,2022-09-04,Planning the Cycling City from the Netherlands to Ireland _ by Lana Salameh @Arup,"Thanks Arup, my colleagues from Ireland and across the European offices from the Transport Planning Skills Network for listening in to my presentation about my course Planning the Cycling City the other day. It was quite the pleasure to do and really encouraging to see how many people attended. The conversation must go on!

My presentation provided an overview of lessons learnt from leaders in the field of cycling cities, specifically from the Netherlands. With recent headlines like ‚ÄúIf we all cycled like the Dutch, global emissions would drop nearly 700 million tonnes‚Äù (Euronews.com), there is no doubt Ireland‚Äôs efforts towards enhancing active travel comes to be of at most significance to curb emissions in the country. 

The presentation covered various topics that include urban cycling (historical and current trends), cycling infrastructure, land use, bicycle culture and effects, bikenomics‚Ä¶ etc in hopes to give as much insight as possible to work towards those goals through our projects and Arup‚Äôs connections with local authorities.

An important thank you once again for the lecturers at the University of Amsterdam ‚Äì Meredith Glaser, Ines Alveano-Aguerrebere, Lior Steinberg, Ruth Oldenziel, Luca Bertolini, Chris Bruntlett, Roland Kager, Marco te Br√∂mmelstroet, Mama Agatha, Katherine VanHoose, Tina Harris, Mijksenaar, Decisio and for the opportunity to get warped into the world of cycling. 

Correction: The map of the speed limits in Amsterdam City is to be implemented in 2023/2024.

Conhecida como ‚ÄúCidade de 15 minutos‚Äù ou ‚ÄúCidade de um quarto de hora‚Äù, a proposta promove o planejamento urbano no n√≠vel do bairro, desincentivando a circula√ß√£o de carros ‚Äì e, consequentemente, a polui√ß√£o causada pelo tr√¢nsito desenfreado das cidades -, descentralizando servi√ßos e tornando a vida poss√≠vel sem a necessidade de grandes deslocamentos.

UawNvCvwMNU,0,2022-09-25,Webinar: Gender Equity and the 15-Minute City,"The 15-minute city model provides and incredible opportunity for enabling more trips to services and amenities within a community in shorter, more walkable distances. Particularly for women, the more connected model of the approach makes performing care trips easier, lessening the burden for women who still perform majority of the care work in homes. 

However, a growing trend is that as cities plan for more walkable/bikeable communities, without proper care of understanding the existing needs in that space, there exists the risk of gentrification, and pushing out the people who would most benefit from this approach to more closely-knit communities ‚Äì single mothers, women of colour, low income families, and other overlooked groups.
 
In this joint collaboration between Women Mobilize Women and C40 cities, and hosted by Mobycon, the opportunities and challenges of the 15-minutes city approach will be discussed.

Dlpy9f321aI,0,2022-09-25,"Realcast: UK leisure and retail recovery, resi tops rewards, 15-minute city back in spotlight","The Local Data Company‚Äôs 26th report shines a light on improvement in the retail and leisure sectors with decreased vacancy and reduced numbers of business closures in the UK.

City centres still lag behind out-of-town centres but just as the worst of the pandemic passed, the Ukraine war, supply chain issues and transport strikes intervened to create what has been labelled ‚Äúthe summer of discontent‚Äù.

But some believe a winter World Cup could help to drive consumers into pubs and restaurants and, as more shopping centre investment and development plans emerge, vacancy rates can be expected to decline further after the all-time high which occurred in H1 2020.

Further afield in hospitality sector deals, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC bought a majority stake in Sani/Ikos Group in a deal that values the Mediterranean luxury resorts operator at ‚Ç¨2.3 billion.

And in the London office sector UK REIT Landsec sold the Deutsche Bank HQ building to LendLease for ¬£809 million, thought to be down on its March valuation, potentially indicating expectations of recession.

Meanwhile, a survey from Bonard analyses residential sector‚Äôs success ‚Äì rent rises of 3‚Äì7% in Western Europe and up to 10‚Äì15% in Eastern European countries are part of it and, while 30% of Europeans rent their housing, this proportion is expected to increase.

Tristan Capital Partners‚Äô CCP 5 Fund has been active at the student accommodation segment of residential with a ¬£110 million acquisition in Liverpool; and CBRE Investment Management has bought a 133-unit residential asset in Berlin, a city in which Hines has also acquired land to develop a project that will extend a new city quarter.

This city quarter concept aligns with the ‚Äú15-minute city‚Äù idea, which has taken a step forward recently as the C40 global network of mayors has formed a partnership with property investor NREP to shape sustainable and equitable cities.

Sustainability was also the main theme of a Real Asset Insight interview with Glasgow City Council about the legacy of COP26. This is also featured in the forthcoming Real Asset Impact.",48,realcast uk leisure retail recovery resi top reward 15 minute city back spotlight local data company 26th report shine light improvement retail leisure sector decreased vacancy reduced number business closure uk city centre still lag behind town centre worst pandemic passed ukraine war supply chain issue transport strike intervened create ha labelled summer discontent believe winter world cup could help drive consumer pub restaurant shopping centre investment development plan emerge vacancy rate expected decline time high occurred h1 2020 afield hospitality sector deal singapore sovereign wealth fund gic bought majority stake sani ikos group deal value mediterranean luxury resort operator 2 3 billion london office sector uk reit landsec sold deutsche bank hq building lendlease 809 million thought march valuation potentially indicating expectation recession meanwhile survey bonard analysis residential sector success rent rise 3 7 western europe 10 15 eastern european country part 30 european rent housing proportion expected increase tristan capital partner ccp 5 fund ha active student accommodation segment residential 110 million acquisition liverpool cbre investment management ha bought 133 unit residential asset berlin city hines ha also acquired land develop project extend new city quarter city quarter concept aligns 15 minute city idea ha taken step forward recently c40 global network mayor ha formed partnership property investor nrep shape sustainable equitable city sustainability wa also main theme real asset insight interview glasgow city council legacy cop26 also featured forthcoming real asset impact,3.0,0,False,

So excited to finally be implementing the urban planning concept of Super Blocks in my 15- minute walkable city of Golden bay! I hope you will join me next time as I continue to use the concept of a 15-Minute City as a framework for building the 100% pedestrian city, Golden Bay! We will be working together to see if a large pedestrian only city is both plausible and functional within Cites Skylines. I'll be using the new Plazas and Promenades DLC along with the NEW content creators packs where applicable.

Una ciudad en la que cada barrio tenga acceso a colegios y escuelas infantiles, centros de salud, bibliotecas, polideportivos, peque√±o comercio, etc. Una ciudad en la que los barrios tengan espacio para las personas y no s√≥lo el coche; barrios vivos, sanos y seguros.

La proximidad hace la vida m√°s f√°cil, pero sobre todo nos regala tiempo. Tiempo para nosotros, para estar con la familia y amigos, para ir al teatro al cine. Tiempo para vivir.

Melanie Lowe of the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia discusses her article, ""A Pathway to Prioritizing and Delivering Healthy and Sustainable Cities,"" co-authored with James F. Sallis, Deborah Salvo, Ester Cerin, Geoff Boeing, Carl Higgs, Shiqin Liu, Erica Hinckson, Deepti Adlakha, Jonathan Arundel, Anne Vernez Moudon, Eugen Resendiz, Billie Giles-Corti; published in Journal of City Climate Policy Volume 1 Number 1, October 2022.

Creating healthy and sustainable cities should be a global priority. Some cities prioritize 15-minute cities as a planning approach with co-benefi ts for health, climate change mitigation, equity, and economic recovery from COVID-19. Yet, as our recent Lancet Global Health series on ‚ÄúUrban Design, Transport, and Health‚Äù showed, many cities have a long way to go to achieve this vision. This policy guideline summarizes the main fi ndings of the series, which assessed health and sustainability indicators for 25 cities in 19 countries. We then outline steps governments can take to strengthen policy frameworks and deliver more healthy, equitable, and sustainable built environments. 

The Lancet Global Health series provided clear evidence that cities need to transform urban governance to enable integrated planning for health and sustainability and commit to policy implementation. Evidence-informed indicators should be used to benchmark and monitor progress. Cities need policy frameworks that are comprehensive and consistent with evidence, with measurable policy targets to support implementation and accountability. The series provided evidenceinformed thresholds for some key urban design and transport features, which can be embedded as policy targets.

But all these names point to one concept. The idea of a 15-minute city is one where a person can fulfill their basic needs within a walkable or bike-able distance ‚Äî which is about 15-minutes. New York City is mostly made up of walkable neighborhoods. This video features an example of a one in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

Melanie Lowe of the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia discusses her article, ""A Pathway to Prioritizing and Delivering Healthy and Sustainable Cities,"" co-authored with James F. Sallis, Deborah Salvo, Ester Cerin, Geoff Boeing, Carl Higgs, Shiqin Liu, Erica Hinckson, Deepti Adlakha, Jonathan Arundel, Anne Vernez Moudon, Eugen Resendiz, Billie Giles-Corti; published in Journal of City Climate Policy Volume 1 Number 1, October 2022.
 
Creating healthy and sustainable cities should be a global priority. Some cities prioritize 15-minute cities as a planning approach with co-benefits for health, climate change mitigation, equity, and economic recovery from COVID-19. Yet, as our recent Lancet Global Health series on ‚ÄúUrban Design, Transport, and Health‚Äù showed, many cities have a long way to go to achieve this vision. This policy guideline summarizes the main findings of the series, which assessed health and sustainability indicators for 25 cities in 19 countries. We then outline steps governments can take to strengthen policy frameworks and deliver more healthy, equitable, and sustainable built environments. 
 
The Lancet Global Health series provided clear evidence that cities need to transform urban governance to enable integrated planning for health and sustainability and commit to policy implementation. Evidence-informed indicators should be used to benchmark and monitor progress. Cities need policy frameworks that are comprehensive and consistent with evidence, with measurable policy targets to support implementation and accountability. The series provided evidence-informed thresholds for some key urban design and transport features, which can be embedded as policy targets. Policies and interventions must prioritize identifying and reducing inequities in access to health-supportive environments. Governments should also invest in open data and promote citizen-science programmes, to support indicator development and research for public benefit.

B8MrdPvffdo,0,2022-10-30,Delivering 20-minute neighbourhoods,"Globally, many cities have made commitments around access-based standards, however, few have drawn up plans to realise the concept. This research used spatial analytics and a framework of quantitative and qualitative place standards to understand the potential for delivering 20-minute neighbourhoods across the nation‚Äôs diverse settlement types.

This project was driven by two key objectives: reducing the reliance on private motor vehicles and decreasing health inequality. The research supports taking a place-based approach. Place-based approaches do not pre-determine a solution or intervention, but instead offer a model which allows for tailored strategies that can tackle multiple challenges, catering for the variation of settlement patterns, and deliver multiple benefits.

GIS mapping was used to understand the spatial opportunities and challenges with delivery, taking account of the diverse settlement patterns across the country. From the baselining exercise, maps were created to show whether neighbourhoods across Scotland are meeting the 20-minute neighbourhood definition as outlined for the project and helped to inform the ambition setting for Scotland in implementing this concept.

ethWMMPa850,0,2022-11-06,15 Minute Upper Body Strength Workout | No Equipment,"Here‚Äôs a 15 minute muscle toning/building upper body workout, that works your arms, chest, back and shoulders that you don‚Äôt need any equipment (apart from a chair) to do.

If you‚Äôre on a fat loss or muscle building journey, doing this workout 2-3x per week will help you burn calories, increase your muscle and help you get stronger.

Each exercise in this upper body workout lasts 40 seconds, with a 10 second rest to change exercise, after each group of exercises we‚Äôll take 45 seconds rest.

Note:

1. Always focus on quality over quantity, build the quantity over time.

2. Pay attention to the tempo (speed of the exercise) and squeeze your muscles hard on every rep.

3. If you can‚Äôt perform an exercise, skip it and replace it for something that keeps you working for the duration of the set.

4. Take the rests, more if you need to and hydrate throughout.

Enjoy the workout!

w2OrdTG1o48,0,2022-11-06,The ward? The parish? The block? What does 'local' mean today? John Thackara with Harris Tiddens,"Today, mega cities such as Tokyo, Delhi, or Shanghai get all the attention - but fewer than 10% of the world‚Äôs city dwellers live in them. Ninety percent of the  world‚Äôs urban population lives in much smaller cities - and a lot more radical action is happening at local level.

2:00 'the word city is empty, we should not use it';
3:42  the city in the middle ages was a living cell;
7:45 in China, smaller units - ‚Äòparishes‚Äô - play an important local role;
11:20 in the EU, ‚Äòlocal‚Äô is often understood to mean a whole city;
15:30 only 1.3% citizens in Hamburg are active in city management affairs;
19:00 worldwide, there‚Äôs a lot of self-organization in 'hoods of 500 people; 
20:00 but more radical action is happening in big cities eg  ‚Äú15 minute Paris""
23:30 a bread baker and brewery in every neighborhood?
25:30 German construction industry getting behind the 15 minute  city
26:40 poly = mostly refit: new buildings are no more than 15% of the challenge;
28:20 Europe‚Äôs old cities were infinitely diverse; these cultural roots are an asset, now;
30:50 the money system makes everything similar; this is a design challenge;
34:00 the Doughnut Economy - transparent and versatile tools

The bollards, which are meant to calm traffic in the roads in Oxford, have been torn down, run over or set fire to by irate drivers.

Some furious objectors have even gone out on foot into Howard Street, Oxford and deliberately destroyed the bollards, while other residents recently showed their support for the bollards through standing in the road to form a human barrier, to prevent cars from entering the area.

Council chiefs in Oxford have now decided to spend ¬£100,000 on replacing the plastic bollards with steel ones to prevent them being uprooted.

According to a release, the project is expected to take between 15-20 years to complete and will see ""35 acres of the riverfront, transform Tower City Center, and prioritize accessibility, equity, sustainability, and resilience with the development of an 18-hour, 15-minute downtown.""

‚ÄúWe are incredibly excited to present our interpretation of the groundbreaking work accomplished in the City‚Äôs Vision for the Valley. The opportunity to provide unparalleled access to the Cuyahoga Riverfront while connecting the area to the downtown core is realized through David Adjaye‚Äôs bold strokes,‚Äù says Kofi Bonner, chief executive officer at Bedrock. ‚ÄúDavid‚Äôs vision not only embraces downtown Cleveland‚Äôs rich history and connection to nature, but also addresses the demands of a world-class city by leveraging sustainable infrastructure and emphasizing pedestrian and transit modes to large activated open spaces.‚Äù

Placing almost everything a city-dweller could need within a 15-minute walk or bike ride is an increasingly important strategy in the pursuit of more sustainable, equitable, and healthier urban environments. Unfortunately, transitioning sprawling, car-centric  megaregions to more compact ‚Äò15-minute‚Äô communities is no easy task. What changes in land use policies should be implemented to create the necessary diversity of housing, jobs, and services? How can technology increase access to opportunities beyond the 15 minute radius, whether it‚Äôs last-mile delivery services providing goods to those who don‚Äôt have their own cars, or technologies that enable remote work?

Panel Discussion:  Building Smart Mobility Systems

New approaches to mobility can transform our cities for the better. Advanced mobility solutions can unlock the potential for 15-minute cities, connectivity between rural areas and urban centers, and expand access to high-income employment opportunities. How can local governments collaborate with startups and scale-ups to get the most effective solutions into the country‚Äôs urban centers and scale them?

Maandag 5 december 2022
- Het afgelopen weekend stond Twitter in het middelpunt van de belangstelling. Elon Musk gaf de eerste tranche van de zogenaamde 'Twitter Files' vrij om zo te laten zien hoe Twitter te werk ging voor zijn overname. Zo zou de FBI hebben afgestemd met Twitter, dat gevoelige informatie van de Hunter Biden-laptop niet geopenbaard werd. Onderzoeksjournalist Daan de Wit dook erin en geeft ons een kijkje in de wereld van censuur.

- Een stad waar je lopend of fietsend alle gemakken in maximaal 15 minuten binnen handbereik hebt, een: '15-Minute City'. In 2024 zal Oxford getransformeerd zijn naar een '15-Minute City', waar de inwoners nog maar twee keer per week met hun auto de stad in en uit mogen. Camera's zullen dat nauwlettend in de gaten houden. Gedragsdeskundige Romy Quint vertelt ons er meer over.

- Was het covid-19 Red Team een 'PSYOP'? ÔªøEen recente WOB-analyse laat zien dat de zogenaamde tegenhanger van het OMT 200 keer in de media kwam, waarvan 50 keer bij de NPO. Door steevast strengere maatregelen te eisen had het Red Team een grote rol in het draagvlak van het corona-overheidsbeleid. Blckbx-redacteur David Boerstra praat ons bij over deze recente WOB-analyse.

Gothenburg is the second largest city in the Nordic country of Sweden, and it's the leading industrial powerhouse of the country. It serves as home to household names like AstraZeneca and Volvo. It's the region's most advanced logistics hub and boasts the biggest port in the country.

The city is recently undergoing a vast multi-billion dollar transformation to make it the commercial heart of Northern Europe by 2035. At the center of it is the Gothenburg city gate tower which will be the tallest office building in the Nordic region when completed.

But if you spent all your time researching what Gothenburg is like, you will only come across how green, sustainable and peaceful Gotenburg is. So you will need clarification about precisely what is going on and how this Swedish city matched blockbuster developments with sustainable growth. 
We must flash back a bit to understand what is happening in this city. Around 40 years ago, Gothenburg underwent a significant change in the 1980s. The shipbuilding industry, which had been necessary to its economy since the 16th century, was in terminal decline. The empty shipyards were converted into a science park, which helped the city become a high-tech research and development hub and doubled as a major trading port.

Then the Gothenburg Development Strategy was announced in 2014 as a comprehensive plan, which would shape the development of the entire city for the next two decades, and it is working from 2016 to 2035.

Over a hundred billion U S Dollars is being invested into expanding infrastructures like the city's port and metro system and building some 55000 new homes. Sweden has one of the best sustainability records in the world, and Gothenburg isn't an exception.

So how do you maintain that reputation while doing so much construction? 

The new city gate tower is an excellent example of how Gothenburg balances massive scale with low environmental impact. Despite being the most significant office building in the Nordic region, it's set to be awarded the highest LEED certification. LEED was set up in the 1990s to recognize buildings constructed to a high environmental standard. Reaching the coveted platinum status is so tough that only a few thousand buildings worldwide have ever been awarded it. With Citygate, those environmental credentials started right from the design and construction stages, recycled aluminum was chosen to create the facade, and a high-tech solution was used for one of the most polluting aspects of the build. Concrete production accounts for about eight percent of all global CO2 emissions. Still, the concrete used at CityGate replaced carbon-intensive cement with fly ash, a by-product of the coal industry, which has very similar properties.

One of the most impressive feats is that the entire building will be powered by a new solar park connected just outside Gothenburg. That's right, the largest office building in Sweden will be 100 percent powered by renewable solar energy.

But it's not just the sustainability of this project which is distinctly Swedish. Almost all of the 144-meter tower was prefabricated.

Sweden has pioneered prefabricated construction, and up to 80 percent of its housing stock has been built this way.

qwEvRWKjHJA,1,2022-12-11,RIBA + VitrA Talk: Carlos Moreno and the 15-minute city,"Daily life in the modern city is structured around long commutes and daily activities far too reliant on the car. Our alarmingly high carbon emissions are ensuring that we are enduring life in poor air quality. In contrast, Carlos Moreno‚Äôs 15-minute city promotes a human-centric and environmentally sustainable urban future.

This is a recording of a live event held at 66 Portland Place in London, on 1 December 2022.

The 15-minute city provides inhabitants with access to all the services they require; housing, work, food, health, education, culture, and leisure, within their immediate vicinity. Restructuring urban life so that each resident could live the urban experience within a 15-minute radius, would revolutionise city living. The hyperlocal global urban movement, as Moreno terms it, would drastically reduce traffic and CO2 emissions, fundamentally increasing the health and wellbeing of people around the world.

Speaker
Carlos Moreno
Professor Carlos Moreno is a Scientific Director at IAE Paris - Sorbonne University (France). He earned recognition as a scientist with an innovative mind and unique approach to urban issues. He works at the heart of issues of international significance, bringing an innovative perspective on urban issues and offering solutions to the issues faced by the cities, metropolises, and territories during the 21st century.

Q&A Chair: Kathryn Firth, Director in Cities, Planning, and Design at Arup

This event is part of our Well Being: Well Built series of talks for the RIBA + VitrA Partnership.

This partnership reflects a shared commitment to add social, economic and cultural value to society, and VitrA Bathrooms are proud to be supporting such an inspiring programme.

With innovation at its core, a global reach and a tradition of collaborating with celebrated architects and designers, the VitrA bathroom brand has become a world leader, synonymous with contemporary sophistication since the mid-1900s.

Residents will be able to travel to destinations within 20 minutes by foot or bicycle.
The initiative intends to beautify urban areas and reduce the carbon footprint.
The 20-minute city will be divided into four centres - sector centre, district centre, community centre, and neighbourhood centre. 
Each sector will feature different amenities such as a co-working hub, shopping centre, hospital, smart police station, school etcetera.
About 55 per cent of the residents will be placed within 800 meters of mass transit stations.
High-density areas will have connected pathways for pedestrians and soft mobility. 
The project is part of the Dubai 2040 Urban Masterplan by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai.

Video of  *3 clips  of videos* about  *15 Minute City*  including   *Katie Hopkins*  talking about the  *Plans for Oxford*
*TIMESTAMPS*

*Clip 1 - Katie Hopkins*

00:07  In Oxford, this has just been passed by the council to divide the city 
into 6 parts
00:22  You will only have the freedom to operate in the part you live
00:29  Everyone will live within 15 mins of the things they need 
00:37  if you want to travel to another zone you will have to go an approved route
00:47  You have to journey around the outside of the city to re-enter another section of the city
00:57  This plan is supposed to be saving the planet 
1:13  This is all done by e-gates - electronic gates and number plate recognition 
1:18  You will be allowed within your 15 min zone and the number plate will know when you leave your zone
1:36  You‚Äôll only be allowed out 100 times a year 
1:41  This is real. I have to stop and say this 
1:44  This has actually been passed by Oxford council 
1:48  this is happening in the next 2 years 2024
1:54  and if you use up all your passes 
2:02  you‚Äôll be fined, your number plate will be recognised
2:05  it will observe you‚Äôve gone somewhere you‚Äôre not allowed 
2:10  and it will fine you ¬£100


*Clip 2  - What is a 15 minute city*

2:20  Clip 2 What is a 15 minute city


*Clip 3 -  Welcome to Oxfordshire Open Prison*

2:59  I used to work for the prison service so I know I know how Open Prisons work
3:01  This is akin to an open prison 
3:03 These districts and filters,gates, fines are being forced on the people of Oxfordshire
3:11  Without their democratic consent 
3:14  1000 people answered an online survey. That‚Äôs not even 1% of the population you are forcing this onto
3:23  This is a Sham whats going on in here today
3:28  Is this democracy?
3:30  This is public question time may I remind you 
3:38  when the people are shut in a separate room 
3:43  and I‚Äôm not in here where you face them with accountability 
3:58  I hope the last remnants that we have of democracy that you will listen to me 
4:05  because I represent the people of Oxfordshire 
4:08  I work in Oxfordshire and there‚Äôs a lot of people out there angry you have not consulted them
4:17  They haven‚Äôt got a clue what‚Äôs going on and if you respect your democracy 
4:22  I speak you you the chair here today and head of the council
4:36  my question is for the head of transport today
4:44 you mentioned a few weeks ago 
4:50  You categorically stated 
4:54  You categorically stated there would not be 6 districts introduced 
5:02  There will be 6 districts introduced 
and you categorically stated that would not happen 
5:12  Do you want me me to play it to everyone?

The concept aims to create cities in which each dweller can do her/his usual main daily activities by walking or at maximum biking"" 15-minute cities are built from a series of 5-minute neighborhoods, also known as complete communities or walkable neighborhoods. The concept has been described as a ""return to a local way of life""

The Holy Spirit will lead, guide you, and teach you all things in truth. Just fully surrender and take His hand. Baptize yourself with water for repentance and ask Him to fill you with His Holy Spirit and then, just walk and talk with him 24-7. It does not require anyone else, just you and Him.

This could have negative impacts on public health, the environment, and quality of life.

High costs of living: The cost of living in a city can be affected by various factors, including the cost of housing, food, and other necessities. If a ""15-minute city"" is a popular or desirable place to live, it could lead to higher demand for housing and other goods and services, which could drive up prices. This could make it difficult for some residents to afford to live in the city.

Lack of affordable housing: If a ""15-minute city"" does not have a sufficient supply of affordable housing, it could result in a shortage of options for low- and moderate-income residents. This could lead to housing insecurity and displacement, as well as social and economic inequality.

Overcrowding and loss of green space: As a city becomes more densely populated, it can lead to overcrowding and a loss of green space. This could have negative impacts on the environment, as well as quality of life for residents.

Social and economic inequality: Cities can also experience social and economic inequality, with some groups benefiting more than others from the city's resources and opportunities.

aBMeiDL-ERM,1,2023-01-01,"Dhaka world‚Äôs most congested cities has opened first metro. 60,000 passengers an hour.#bangladehs","One of the world‚Äôs most congested cities has opened its first metro.Bangladesh‚Äôs new metro system is expected to transport 60,000 passengers an hour.
Green mobility solutions became the transport of choice for many during the pandemic.

As office workers return to cities, and mass-transit services resume operation, congestion is increasing.
We outline three key ways to encourage new mobility options for the long-term, without reducing mass-transit ridership.

Make long-term green mobility plans and stick to them

To work effectively, measures to promote new modes of green mobility need to be part of a wider plan. Cities such as Paris are already implementing these strategies. The French capital announced in 2020 that it would become a ‚Äú15-minute city‚Äù ‚Äì one in which residents can easily reach essential services in that time by bike or on foot. Amsterdam, which regularly scores highly for urban mobility, announced in 2019 that it would remove 11,000 parking spaces by 2025 to make the city greener and more accessible. It combined this with other strategies, such as getting people to exchange their cars for a shared-mobility budget for one or two months.
But the politics of implementing these plans are often tricky. Some motorists become disgruntled when parking spots are reduced. Brussels, for example, is struggling to extend its network of bike paths in the face of complaints that cheap, on-street parking places will be lost. Some Paris shopkeepers said plans to build 110 miles (180 kms) of permanent segregated bike paths between 2021 and 2026 could ruin their businesses.
That makes it essential to frame new green mobility policies in positive terms and not in opposition to cars. Each measure needs to show a clear improvement in affordability, urban environment and travel from point A to B. Ultimately, cities need a long-term strategy that has clear objectives and does not depend on election cycles, which are too short for significant improvements in infrastructure ‚Äì and for these to yield results.

DcHqC3MfGQY,1,2023-01-01,15 MINUTE CITIES UK,"*15 MINUTE CITIES UK* 
Video of  *2 Clips*  of  People talking about  The  *15 Minute City Model* -  The  Oxfordshire 15 minute city
*TIMESTAMPS*
Clip 1
00:01  Lockdown 2024 is actually happening 
00:05  a Plan by Oxford city to be divided into 6 districts 
00:12  Everyone in each district will be in a section of 15 minutes 
00:20  you only have 100 free passes a year to travel to another district 
00:25  I live 20 mins from Oxford. it‚Äôs Real. it‚Äôs literally happening 
00:29  Google it. it‚Äôs happening in 2024
The council have approved it
00:33  it is going to go ahead 
00:36. it‚Äôs apparently to combat climate change and emissions from cars
00:40  rumoured the council were going to build an electronic e-gates on
00:44  roads to systematically let people in and out
00:48  going to use AMPR Cameras that recognises your number plate
00:52  to see how many passes you have left
00:54  Track your car‚Äôs location 
00:55  If you use up all your 100 passes a year, You Will Be Fined
1:13  trying to make you stay inside 
1:15  15 mins to everything so you don‚Äôt have to leave 
1:20  If you do have to leave you‚Äôre going to be tracked and have certain amount of passes
1:25  then you‚Äôre charged to go into another district 
1:29  you only have 100 passes to go through
1:32  And say you‚Äôre married, and have two cars and both go to work different jobs 
1:34  You still only have 100 passes 
1:38  50 passes each a year to drive in and out of the district 
1:44  This isn‚Äôt because of climate change 
1:46  Its just another way for the government to control you, restrict and keep tabs on you
1:52  again, this is real. it is happening 

Clip 2
1:59  The 15 min city concept is simple
2:05  saying that every urban citizen should be able to meet their basic needs within 15 minutes 
2:14  It was proposed by scientist Carlos Moreno
2:38  the WEF say the rearrangement of cities is absolutely about climate change

The 15 Minute City

In the¬†WEF‚Äôs own words¬†‚Äî this rearrangement of cities is absolutely about climate change.

It‚Äôs permanent climate lockdown.

The¬†15 minute city¬†is not just Oxford, but turning up in¬†Brisbane,¬†Melbourne,¬†Barcelona, Paris, Portland and Buenos Aires. It‚Äôs everywhere.

Oxford, England, is where the madness of the 15-minute system is first being implemented.¬†James Woudhuysen:

The green agenda is taking inspiration from the illiberal days of lockdown.

To this end, Oxfordshire County Council, which is run by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party, wants to¬†divide the city of Oxford into six ‚Äò15 minute‚Äô districts. In these districts, it is said, most household essentials will be accessible by a quarter-of-an-hour walk or bike ride, and so residents will have no need for a car.

On the surface, these 15-minute neigbourhoods might sound pleasant and convenient.¬†But there is a coercive edge. The council plans to cut car use and traffic congestion by placing strict rules on car journeys. ‚Ä¶

Residents will have to register their cars with the council and they will be tracked to count their journeys through the key gateways.

Under the new proposals, if any of Oxford‚Äôs 150,000 residents drives outside of their designated district more than 100 days a year, he or she could be fined ¬£70.

This is just my opinion.

eeHMg4flcbo,1,2023-01-08,Walking with Urban Designers | Exploring Spatial Destinations through an Urban Design Context,"CanU 2022 Webinar
December 1, 2022 (Thursday)

The relationship between a person‚Äôs mobility, i.e., walking, bicycle, wheelchair, car, is a basic human consideration in providing for daily needs. This relationship is, or should be, a fundamental determinant of responsible urban design. We all have basic needs and good urban design should ensure that you can meet these needs as safely and conveniently as possible. The popular idea of the ‚Äú15 minute city‚Äù implies ‚Äúaccessibility to needs within a reasonable distance as a pedestrian or as a cyclist‚Äù. It is a good idea and used by many people, from real estate agents to conference promoters, but urban designers need to understand the details. How do you design communities to enable this relationship, what should you also be able to access in a 2, 5 and 10 minute walk, bike or wheelchair ride (its further than you think), and what about non-city areas such as suburban, town, and rural conditions?

Join the CanU ‚ÄúWalking with Urban Designer‚Äù session to explore well-illustrated best practices in different regions of Canada as presented by local urban design practitioners. Examine the benefits that active transportation promotion provides for public health outcomes and in the face of climate change. Review the design implications of weather, mobility, and special-needs choices: can you get transit to school and shops, how well is the route designed, is it a positive experience or a daily drudgery?

The session is broken into 2 distinct parts. The first will examine, through 3 local urban designers in Alberta, Quebec, and Ontario, the considerations required in a variety of; urban infill, new community suburban and an international city contexts, through short and engaging presentations. The second half will facilitate an open working session with you to provide practical working experience, to help to answer your questions, and to discuss your issues.

-DBkj9ax98A,1,2023-01-08,Climate Fascism: Fact or Fiction,"""15-minute cities"" is an urban planning concept that aims to create cities in which all necessary daily goods, services, and amenities are within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from any residence within the city. The idea behind 15-minute cities is to promote sustainable and equitable urban development by reducing reliance on cars and encouraging more active forms of transportation, such as walking and biking. This concept is based on the idea that the average person can walk or bike about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) in about 15 minutes. By designing cities so that most daily needs can be met within this distance, it is thought that people will be more likely to use active transportation, which can help to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, by making it easier for people to access the goods and services they need without relying on cars, 15-minute cities can help to create more livable and equitable communities.

Semua yang Anda butuhkan berada dalam 15 menit berjalan kaki atau bersepeda dari tempat tinggal Anda. 

Anda hanya akan memiliki kebebasan untuk beraktifitas pada tempat tertentu yang sudah ditetapkan. Jadi, jika idenya adalah semua orang akan hidup dalam 15 menit dari hal-hal yang mereka butuhkan seperti 15 menit dari sekolah, 15 menit dari dokter, 15 menit dari supermarket, dll. Bukankah ini seperti pembatasan bersyarat di dalam smart city?

Dan jika Anda ingin melakukan perjalanan ke tempat lain di kota Anda, maka Anda harus keluar dari rute yang sudah ditentukan dan disetujui. Anda harus mengikuti rute perjalanan di sekitar bagian luar dari zona Anda untuk masuk ke bagian dari kota lain.

Berada di Kota 15-Menit hanya diperkenankan dengan mengggunakan kenderaan keluar zonanya sebanyak 100 kali dalam setahun. Kota 15-Menit adalah penyamaran dari Climate Change. Kota Covid Lockdown!

Yes
14%
No
86%

A Davos speaker explicitly outlined the World Economic Forum‚Äôs agenda when he stated that the goal was to create a ‚Äúnew world order.‚Äù

The remarks were made during the annual elitist confab yesterday January 19th, 2023 by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Pakistan‚Äôs Minister of Foreign Affairs.

‚ÄúHere at WEF‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a lot of discussion about what the new world order will be‚Ä¶how do we work towards that new normative international order that allows us to address our differences and disputes as the civilized world,‚Äù said Zardari.

The world is moving fast to a new order! One of the items on the agenda this week in Davos is 15-minute cities coming to a city near you.  They want to limit your movement and turn you into a surf!

The Davos Agenda will also mark the launch of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Great Reset Initiative and begin the preparation of the Special Annual Meeting in the spring. Each day of the meeting will focus on one of the five domains of the Great Reset Initiative:

The Davos Agenda aims to inform the global public and the World Economic Forum‚Äôs social media followers on the key issues shaping the year ahead. It will also engage over 430 cities in 150 countries that host Global Shapers, a network of young people driving dialogue, action, and change.

Monday 25 January: Designing cohesive, sustainable and resilient economic systems;
Tuesday 26 January: Driving responsible industry transformation and growth;
Wednesday 27 January: Enhancing stewardship of our global commons;
Thursday 28 January: Harnessing the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and
Friday 29 January: Advancing global and regional cooperation.

0NlKE3GUOAc,1,2023-01-15,David Carpin - The Oxford Experiment With 15 Minute Cities,"15 minute cities or 20 minute neighbourhoods are a dangerous experiment that is pushed by many progressive politicians in many areas of the UK and beyond. 
The idea sounds idyllic, to make sure that everything you need is available within 15 mins walk or cycle ride from your front door. 
But it is being driven by the green lobby who are pushing for net zero and It is an attack on the motorist. 
Oxford, The City of Dreaming Spires, is famous the world over for its University and place in history, for over 800 years, it has been a home to royalty and scholars and now it is one of the first cities in the UK to trial this measure where it is proposed that the metropolis will be divided up into zones and each household will receive 100 passes to allow them to travel outside of their area. 
Anyone driving outside of their zone without the required paperwork will be fined ¬£70 using a network of cameras. 
David Carpin joins us as the Reform Party candidate for Henley and the local council, he tells us what lies behind this scheme and why the elected assembly have ignored local opposition and why the Reform Party are the main political opposition to this.

Rapid defibrillation saves lives, and the sooner people receive a shock from an AED, the higher their chances of survival. 

Our 4 Minute Cities strive to make an AED available within 4 minutes of collapse from Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) through:
 ‚Ä¢ Strategic, data-driven placement of cutting-edge Avive Connect AEDs‚Ñ¢ where they can do the most good, for the most people
 ‚Ä¢ Connecting the actions of bystanders, 911 dispatchers, Fire/EMS, and healthcare providers to create a cohesive pre-hospital system of response
 ‚Ä¢ Massive community training and awareness activities 

This video featuring our CEO, Sameer Jafri, and some of our 4 Minute City Program partners, explains what the 4 Minute City Program is, and how it works.

KrsAU8QlbXk,1,2023-01-22,Tha Apocalypse Bike and the 15 minute City. Reflecting on the Olde Ways,"Here's my comment as left on Neil Olivers video. I thought it would make for an interesting video and a chance to look at the village where I grew up and reflect on the old ways Oh ah.......Those in power are crackpots I tell's ya...!
Wiltshire Man
In the early part of the last century (the 20th century) there were a small number of village people very elderly who I was told hardly ever  ventured beyond the parish boundary. Maybe once or twice a year they may have bicycled 7 miles to the nearest town of Swindon. They lived in a 15 minute village!
Fresh eggs and produce from the allotment or the back garden .
In the villages all the houses had good sized gardens and  all were carefully tilled and tended with pride, some kept chickens and the odd garden even had a sty for a pig. It was just as important back then to grow veg as it was to go to work. The garden put food on the table, good wholesome food.
A solid steel frame bicycle was used for transport down to the highstreet were there was a thrift shop which sold cloths and shoe's and there was a hardware shop that sold seeds and paraffin, garden tools etc infact you could get almost anything there, even a glass of sherry or delicious sliced ham. and the village had 4 pubs a newsagent/ tobaconsist, a mens  club, a butchers shop,  a fish n chip shop, a corner shop, a co op, a greengrocers, three garages and a blacksmiths shop and two churches, one Methodist and the other Anglican.
If anything heavy or awkward needed to be transported they had a wheelbarrow:)
What they never had they never missed, yes a type of 15 minute city I suppose but in a good way.
The new 15 minute city will be horrendous, not at all like the old one just described and the food will be little better than plastic and you'll have to eat it because the postage stamp garden probably cheek by jowl with a neighbours and in constant shadow will struggle to grow anything to sustain good health, and the poor people who live in such places won't even have a chimney or fireplace and they'll be paying through the nose for the pleasure of living in such a place, in all probability they won't own their home, they'll be renting and they won't be happy.
It's been insidious this decline of humanity, the wealth and quality of life has been transferred away from the many and all they have left is bare sustenance and for some that only with the help of a food bank oh but they do have Nike trainers and a smart phone!
How much more can people take before they push people over the edge. I count myself fortunate because I was brought up in a village like the one described earlier and learned some of the old ways, I also have a good sized garden and a woodburner. I've only ever been on a plane 3 or 4 times in my life and to be quite honest it wouldn't bother me too much if I never went abroad ever again, I'm fairly content and fairly fortunate, but it's the younger generation that I feel sad for....They don't have a strong connection to the old ways anymore thanks to technology and the  way things have gone!",15652,tha apocalypse bike 15 minute city reflecting olde way comment left neil oliver video thought would make interesting video chance look village grew reflect old way oh ah power crackpot tell ya wiltshire man early part last century 20th century small number village people elderly wa told hardly ever ventured beyond parish boundary maybe twice year may bicycled 7 mile nearest town swindon lived 15 minute village fresh egg produce allotment back garden village house good sized garden carefully tilled tended pride kept chicken odd garden even sty pig wa important back grow veg wa go work garden put food table good wholesome food solid steel frame bicycle wa used transport highstreet wa thrift shop sold cloth shoe wa hardware shop sold seed paraffin garden tool etc infact could get almost anything even glass sherry delicious sliced ham village 4 pub newsagent tobaconsist men club butcher shop fish n chip shop corner shop co op greengrocer three garage blacksmith shop two church one methodist anglican anything heavy awkward needed transported wheelbarrow never never missed yes type 15 minute city suppose good way new 15 minute city horrendous like old one described food little better plastic eat postage stamp garden probably cheek jowl neighbour constant shadow struggle grow anything sustain good health poor people live place even chimney fireplace paying nose pleasure living place probability home renting happy insidious decline humanity wealth quality life ha transferred away many left bare sustenance help food bank oh nike trainer smart phone much people take push people edge count fortunate wa brought village like one described earlier learned old way also good sized garden woodburner ever plane 3 4 time life quite honest bother much never went abroad ever fairly content fairly fortunate younger generation feel sad strong connection old way anymore thanks technology way thing gone,1239.0,401,False,

LYRICS:
What‚Äôs in your heads in those test beds? any reality getting through?
Or are you stuck in a daze where they‚Äôre A OK, those plans in place for you?
well pretty soon the truth‚Äôs gotta hit you, a bolt out of the blue
Will you ask yourself will you wonder, why did we all not warn you?

They‚Äôve been so slow and gradual, so patient training you
They numbed ya and they‚Äôve dumbed ya down, some part of you knows that‚Äôs true
Do you care what‚Äôs in that contract between the state and you?
While they lock you up and tie you down, why do you let them blindfold you?

Low impact compact living, looks like what‚Äôs in store for you
All they say you need it‚Äôll all be there, all laid out for you
Energy and travel only essentials now for you
You don‚Äôt have nowhere else you need to be, do you??

Chorus
15 minute city
15 minute life
All that you need within it
What‚Äôs not to like?

15 minute city
squeezing your life so tight.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is:
You‚Äòll be in prison, serving life

Verse 2

They spooked you perfectly with their spoof emergency
got to prevent catastrophe, that's their so familiar plea
now the future rests on you good slave, your compliance will be the key
They say you‚Äôll save mother earth and you‚Äôll save humanity

They sell your cage it like it‚Äôs so cool, a place you‚Äôll wanna be
fresher air with no pollution, open spaces, greenery,
and the things you‚Äôve hungered so much for they‚Äôll tell you that there‚Äôll be
human closeness and cohesion of something called community,

Your CBDC balance will update incessantly
only grows when you show how submissive you can be -
Passes out they are a privilege, and issued sparingly
They can‚Äôt permit you inmates to keep dreaming that you‚Äôre free

Chorus 2

15 minute city,
They promise you you‚Äôll like
15 minute city
Your high tech open prison life
15 minute city
You might think it sounds all right
15 minute city
All your rights revoked - it's for the planet, and wildlife

(GUITAR SOLO)

Your keepers they don‚Äôt care at all, if you take a view
Just you be grateful, that they pretend, that they‚Äôre consulting you
smiling kindly while trapping you, in the eco-zoo
One cup of bugs per day, unless you‚Äôve earned the points for two

Final chorus

15 minute city, 15 minute life
15 minute city, 15 minute life

15 minute city
They count on you to welcome it, not put up any fight
15 minute city
For the planet, You know it‚Äôs only right
15 minute city
Shrink that footprint so tight
15 minute city
Your future‚Äôs not so bright
15 minute city
looking dark, darker, than shite
15 minute city
Agenda 2030, unfolding in plain sight

I am a Canadian Military Veteran and a single Dad of 2 beautiful Daughters.  I released from the Military 3 years ago and shortly after I had a SpiRiTuaL AwAkEniNG.

The SouL AiD UniTy MaRcH: I just finished Marching BareFooT (320km) from Jasper, AB. To Canmore, AB. For Homelessness, First Nations Rights, and for Freedom (July 21 to August 1, 2022 Aquarius) The purpose of this march, called the SouL AiD UniTy March, was to raise $1,000,000 to build a Homeless Solution, called UniTy ViLLaGe on land that I am going to purchase so that the failing/falling government has no part in it.  No red tape = real help and progress.  The government does NOT have our best interests at hand.

The ONE TriBe Transition Home: I currently have 6 former Homeless Folks living in my garage here in Spruce Grove. I decided to convert my stand-alone garage into a 4 person Garden-Suite to help our brothers and Sisters off of the streets without the bullshit government red tape that keeps them there! Check it out here: https://youtu.be/4YFPDuBhG_g

The Government, The City of Spruce Grove, AB., The Free (Not For Long) masons, the old money that runs this town, and my homeless hating neighbors, who think property values and material possessions are more important than Souls and vessels, are doing everything in their power to try and stop me.  The city has condemned my garage and given me $20,000 (yes that‚Äôs 4 zeros) in ByLaw and other various tickets, but I told them to go pound salt and I‚Äôll never stop helping these folks.  I‚Äôll die for every one of these missions and I don‚Äôt need credit.  I also have no problem going to jail for these causes and I have NO FEAR. PERIOD!

1m-B_wYYEUk,1,2023-02-05,"15 Minute Cities: The Lockdown ""New Normal""","Many people are claiming it is a conspiracy theory to be concerned that ""15 minute cities"" might become a new form of #Lockdown - this time for climate versus COVID.  Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, took a look at the time line of some events and 'targets' - from Yvo de Boer (then Exec Sec of the UNFCCC) claiming at the Paris Agreement of 2015 that we'd have to shut down the global economy - to the report by a consulting firm ""ARUP"" called ""Deadline 2020"" which said the C40 cities should get citizens down to a 2 tCO2e (2 ton carbon dioxide equivalent) footprint through a 15 minute city structure, where all services are within a 15 minute walk or bike ride. [Canadians had a typical carbon footprint of ~17 tCO2e per capita in 2016; Cubans have a carbon footprint of about 2 tCO2e per capita. Stark difference.] Curiously, in September of 2019, a very large report called ""Exponential Roadmap"" came out in which climate activist scientists Johan Rockstrom called for a ""Moonshot"" (alluding to the Apollo missions) and an application of a kind of ""Moore's Law"" (alluding to the rapid capacity increase in computing power on a chip, but for emissions reduction).  Rockstrom also advocates for a global carbon tax LAW and his starting point is $400/t.  The confluence of these proposals and the timing of long-term lockdowns (when we were told it would just take 2 weeks or a month to 'flatten the curve') indicates that we may have already been through ""climate lockdowns"" that piggybacked on the COVID epidemic, setting the stage for the WEF's Fourth Industrial Revolution (for which many 'solutions' for 15 minute cities are in the works.  Michelle speculates, with various points of evidence, that behavioral 'nudge' psychology has been employed and that patterns of behaviour have been tracked and analyzed during the lockdowns, to provide data to 'nudge' people into the 'comfort and convenience' of 15 minute cities.  While the idea of restructuring very DENSE city areas with little room for cars into these 15 minute walking cities might make sense for places like Barcelona on the balmy Mediterranean, they make little sense for low densities cities in Canada, where temperatures are freezing half the year and cabin fever is a 'thing.'  The confluence of health care and climate change is also an uneasy mix, and Dr. Aaron Kheriaty's book ""The New Abnormal"" is cited as a resource.  COVID has upset global geopolitics as well, and this means supply chains will continue to fall apart, as outlined in Peter Zeihan's book ""The End of the World is just the Beginning..."" about geopolitics.  Based on his research, nations will need all the financial and material resources they can find to manage the bumpy road ahead - and 'human-caused' climate change will be the last of our concerns as solar activity enters a Grand Solar Minimum.  This is a somewhat speculative presentation, but worth watching to see how climate change is being used as a lever to take away your freedoms.

15 MINUTE CITIES PROTEST
WHEN: Friday Feb 10, 2023
WHERE: Edmonton, Alberta on Whyte Ave (by the clear bathrooms)
TIME: 1500HRS -or- 3pm

I AM. Trevor One Feather. LiGhT WaRRioR, EarTh TeAcHeR and Keeper of the Violet Flame. https://www.WorldCampfireInitiative.com

I am a Canadian Military Veteran and a single Dad of 2 beautiful Daughters.  I released from the Military 3 years ago and shortly after I had a SpiRiTuaL AwAkEniNG.  Ever since that day I have been blessed to work for SpiRiT, as a conduit, to put forth Unconditional LoVe and to raise Unity Consciousness as we head towards the Global Ascension of Mother Gaia and ALL of her inhabitants BEFORE 2023.

The SouL AiD UniTy MaRcH: I just finished Marching BareFooT (320km) from Jasper, AB. To Canmore, AB. For Homelessness, First Nations Rights, and for Freedom (July 21 to August 1, 2022 Aquarius) The purpose of this march, called the SouL AiD UniTy March, was to raise $1,000,000 to build a Homeless Solution, called UniTy ViLLaGe on land that I am going to purchase so that the failing/falling government has no part in it.  No red tape = real help and progress.  The government does NOT have our best interests at hand.

The ONE TriBe Transition Home: I currently have 6 former Homeless Folks living in my garage here in Spruce Grove. I decided to convert my stand-alone garage into a 4 person Garden-Suite to help our brothers and Sisters off of the streets without the bullshit government red tape that keeps them there! Check it out here: https://youtu.be/4YFPDuBhG_g

The Government, The City of Spruce Grove, AB., The Free (Not For Long) masons, the old money that runs this town, and my homeless hating neighbors, who think property values and material possessions are more important than Souls and vessels, are doing everything in their power to try and stop me.  The city has condemned my garage and given me $20,000 (yes that‚Äôs 4 zeros) in ByLaw and other various tickets, but I told them to go pound salt and I‚Äôll never stop helping these folks.  I‚Äôll die for every one of these missions and I don‚Äôt need credit.  I also have no problem going to jail for these causes and I have NO FEAR. PERIOD!

I wrote the song in the background for the Hope for the Needy Mission in Uganda. Its called ""ToUcH ThE SuN""Check out the full version here: https://youtu.be/526Vpm52RTE

I am a Canadian Military Veteran and a single Dad of 2 beautiful Daughters.  I released from the Military 3 years ago and shortly after I had a SpiRiTuaL AwAkEniNG.  Ever since that day I have been blessed to work for SpiRiT, as a conduit, to put forth Unconditional LoVe and to raise Unity Consciousness as we head towards the Global Ascension of Mother Gaia and ALL of her inhabitants BEFORE 2023.

The SouL AiD UniTy MaRcH: I just finished Marching BareFooT (320km) from Jasper, AB. To Canmore, AB. For Homelessness, First Nations Rights, and for Freedom (July 21 to August 1, 2022 Aquarius) The purpose of this march, called the SouL AiD UniTy March, was to raise $1,000,000 to build a Homeless Solution, called UniTy ViLLaGe on land that I am going to purchase so that the failing/falling government has no part in it.  No red tape = real help and progress.  The government does NOT have our best interests at hand.

The Government, The City of Spruce Grove, AB., The Free (Not For Long) masons, the old money that runs this town, and my homeless hating neighbors, who think property values and material possessions are more important than Souls and vessels, are doing everything in their power to try and stop me.  The city has condemned my garage and given me $20,000 (yes that‚Äôs 4 zeros) in ByLaw and other various tickets, but I told them to go pound salt and I‚Äôll never stop helping these folks.  I‚Äôll die for every one of these missions and I don‚Äôt need credit.  I also have no problem going to jail for these causes and I have NO FEAR. PERIOD!

bITUGtceWfs,1,2023-02-05,#shorts  15 Minute Cities - Calgary Clears Snow off Walking Paths But Not The Roads,"#shorts   15 Minute Cities - Calgary Clears Snow off Walking Paths But Not The Roads

15-minute cities are essentially turning any major metropolitan area into a concentration camp. They are going to split the city up into a number of zones and then allow you permission to cross over into these zones a limited number of times per year.  Should you cross over into another Zone beyond the number of times allotted to you, you will be fined.

The fines are going to come in the mail because this will all be digitally done. Face recognition software and software that reads license plates will issue a ticket to you should you cross into another Zone without permission.

They have begun this all over Canada by introducing bike lanes that nobody uses and by continuing to pour out propaganda stating that somehow human beings are capable of heating up the planet.

The truth be known, the propaganda is actually more dangerous than the surveillance systems themselves because the average person out there does not seem to be smart enough to ignore the messages that are being sent to them.

You can see me on a walking trail beside the Bow River where there are absolutely no businesses aside from a driving range around this path yet the path has been scraped completely clear of snow and ice where the highways and the roads in some cases have 3 inches of snow and packed ice on them.

This is the City of Calgary trying to tell you that walking is the better way to go, which I agree if where you're walking is within 5 km but Calgary much like every Canadian city is spread out obnoxiously so, and there is no way to get anywhere quickly on foot. I know this because I have walked more than 60% of the streets in Calgary and I know exactly how long it takes to walk anywhere in town.

Naturally, many of you are going to believe that this is somehow good for the planet but the same number of you that believe this probably still believe in the tooth fairy as well.

Ajyo-965RuM,1,2023-02-12,Heavy police presence as demonstrators face off during Oxford LTN protest,"Footage of anti-LTN protesters in Oxford this afternoon (Feb 18). Demonstrators gathered amid a heavy police presence to oppose Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). They were met by counterprotestors, mainly from antifa-based groups, who had gathered to oppose reported ""far-right elements"" at the demo. 

The policies, aimed at reducing city congestion, have proved controversial. LTNs were introduced by Oxfordshire County Council¬†to block residential streets using bollards or planters, stopping vehicles using them as cut-through routes. LTNs are popular with some residents who say they have made roads safer but others say they have made roads more congested and damaged businesses. #15minutecities #Oxford

g3nIXMA1j3E,1,2023-02-12,How ‚Äô15-minute cities‚Äô became a lockdown conspiracy - BBC Newsnight,"To reduce carbon emissions and meet climate goals, politicians in Oxford are attempting to restrict the number of times some vehicles can drive through the city each year while still allowing unlimited access via the City's ring road. 

The city also has a long-term plan to be a 15-minute city, where food, medicine, education, and leisure facilities are all within a 15-minute walk or cycle from someone‚Äôs front door.

This plan has been conflated with its traffic-restriction trial by conspiracy theories that present the measures as a form of climate lockdown.

Newsnight‚Äôs Science Correspondent Kate Lamble reports on how a conspiracy theory about ""15-minute cities"" became tangled with some people's real concerns over the measures.

RcOrNojCG00,1,2023-02-12,#Lockdowns: The Door Opener for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and 15 Minute Cities,"Many people are claiming it is a conspiracy theory to be concerned that ""15 minute cities"" might become a new form of #Lockdown - this time for climate versus COVID.  Michelle Stirling, Communications Manager for Friends of Science Society, took a look at the time line of some events and 'targets' - from Yvo de Boer (then Exec Sec of the UNFCCC) claiming at the Paris Agreement of 2015 that we'd have to shut down the global economy - to the report by a consulting firm ""ARUP"" called ""Deadline 2020"" which said the C40 cities should get citizens down to a 2 tCO2e (2 ton carbon dioxide equivalent) footprint through a 15 minute city structure, where all services are within a 15 minute walk or bike ride. [Canadians had a typical carbon footprint of ~17 tCO2e per capita in 2016; Cubans have a carbon footprint of about 2 tCO2e per capita. Stark difference.] Curiously, in September of 2019, a very large report called ""Exponential Roadmap"" came out in which climate activist scientists Johan Rockstrom called for a ""Moonshot"" (alluding to the Apollo missions) and an application of a kind of ""Moore's Law"" (alluding to the rapid capacity increase in computing power on a chip, but for emissions reduction).  Rockstrom also advocates for a global carbon tax LAW and his starting point is $400/t.  The confluence of these proposals and the timing of long-term lockdowns (when we were told it would just take 2 weeks or a month to 'flatten the curve') indicates that we may have already been through ""climate lockdowns"" that piggybacked on the COVID epidemic, setting the stage for the WEF's Fourth Industrial Revolution (for which many 'solutions' for 15 minute cities are in the works.  Michelle speculates, with various points of evidence, that behavioral 'nudge' psychology has been employed and that patterns of behaviour have been tracked and analyzed during the lockdowns, to provide data to 'nudge' people into the 'comfort and convenience' of 15 minute cities.  While the idea of restructuring very DENSE city areas with little room for cars into these 15 minute walking cities might make sense for places like Barcelona on the balmy Mediterranean, they make little sense for low densities cities in Canada, where temperatures are freezing half the year and cabin fever is a 'thing.'  The confluence of health care and climate change is also an uneasy mix, and Dr. Aaron Kheriaty's book ""The New Abnormal"" is cited as a resource.  COVID has upset global geopolitics as well, and this means supply chains will continue to fall apart, as outlined in Peter Zeihan's book ""The End of the World is just the Beginning..."" about geopolitics.  Based on his research, nations will need all the financial and material resources they can find to manage the bumpy road ahead - and 'human-caused' climate change will be the last of our concerns as solar activity enters a Grand Solar Minimum.  This is a somewhat speculative presentation, but worth watching to see how climate change is being used as a lever to take away your freedoms.

kfFexRjvwvY,1,2023-02-19,The Circulation Plan is completely crazy,"#shorts 
Canterbury Council has received huge backlash against controversial new plans which could reduce private vehicle usage and divide the city into five zones.

Canterbury Council is one of the latest councils in Britain to announce radical new development plans with a focus on 15-minute cities. Within the draft plan there is a controversial plan called ‚ÄòThe Canterbury Circulation Plan‚Äô which proposes to divide the city in five zones and apply some restrictions to the use of private vehicles.

Private use vehicles under the new proposal would be able to travel freely within their zone. However, when travelling to other zones they would need to take a new bypass which is yet to be constructed. The radical new proposals are intended ease congestion in the city, reduce pollution, improve air quality and make the city centre better for pedestrians and cyclists.

We wanted to find out about these 15 minute cities everyones on about, and why the british people even care! During our exploration we discovered a little old fellow who goes by the name Piers Corbyn, aparently he's Jeremy Corbyns Brother (no idea). Any way, he was quite happy to share his views on the current state of the country, the impact of LTNs (low traffic networks or sommet) and what he's doing to help defend the rights of those impacted.
This is an exclusive clip we thought we'd release  ahead of the next episode of Street View - cos the Geeza seemed important, or at least put well put together - where we'll be further covering the Oxford protest and the views and crazy characters that make their appearance.

And a debate is raging about that particular concept. Infact, if you have been spending time on social media for a reasonable period of time everyday, you must have come across the debate around the concept of ‚Äô15 Minute Cities‚Äô. Although the concept in itself seems to be beneficial, but it has also sparked outrage‚Ä¶ and is facing backlash because of the concerns that it will be like a real-life jail for everyone‚Ä¶.a jail in which your freedom will be severely restricted and curtailed. Very recently, UK member of parliament  Nick Fletcher had ignited a huge protest after stating that those cities ""will take away personal freedoms"". Fletcher had gone to the extent of calling for a ""debate on the international socialist concept of so-called 15-minute cities and 20-minute neighbourhoods"".

Accelerationism, amphetamine philosophy, and the Death Trip

https://julesevans.medium.com/accelerationism-amphetamine-philosophy-and-the-death-trip-bb67ff079f8

This is a story about dangerous ideas, and words‚Äô magical power to heal and to harm. It‚Äôs about AI, Charles Manson, dubstep, Neo-Nazis, occultism, and a lot of amphetamine, but it‚Äôs mainly about Nicholas Land.
Nick Land in the 1990s

In 1993, techno-feminist Sadie Plant set up a research unit in the philosophy department at Warwick University called the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU). It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äòreal‚Äô academic centre ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt have a large grant or any institutional status, it was just a piece of paper on a door. But the name drew people into its vortex. The dominant influence in the CCRU became a 30-year-old mid-career researcher called Nick Land ‚Äî a fan of continental critical theorists like Deleuze, Guattari and George Bataille.

Land and the CCRU mixed together cyberpunk, science-fiction, cryptocurrency, drugs and post-humanism, drained it through the mesh of continental theory, and created Accelerationism. Guardian journalist Andy Beckett has a good definition:

    Accelerationists argue that technology, particularly computer technology, and capitalism, particularly the most aggressive, global variety, should be massively sped up and intensified ‚Äî either because this is the best way forward for humanity, or because there is no alternative. Accelerationists favour automation. They favour the further merging of the digital and the human. They often favour the deregulation of business, and drastically scaled-back government. They believe that people should stop deluding themselves that economic and technological progress can be controlled. They often believe that social and political upheaval has a value in itself.

Accelerationalism began life as the British cousin of the Californian philosophy of Extropianism, which also began in the early 1990s (as I wrote here). There‚Äôs a similar anarcho-libertarianism, hyper-capitalism, worship of new technology and expectation of a sudden leap beyond the human. But this wasn‚Äôt California, it was Coventry ‚Äî and Accelerationism was much darker and more nihilistic than Californian transhumanism. After all, Land‚Äôs first book was called ‚ÄòThirst for Annihilation‚Äô.

Land has said: ‚ÄòI have no interest in human liberation, or liberation of the human species. I‚Äôm interested in liberation of the means of production‚Äô. In other words, Accelerationism had nothing to do with expanding human potential. This was not Californian self-help. This was about liberating the machine from the human. Accelerationism aimed to push capitalism further and faster, until it‚Äôs just machines whirring round in a lifeless universe. Pure Fordism.

The CCRU grew out of cybernetics, and the sense that humans are agents in a world full of other agents ‚Äî machines, ecosystems, DNA, perhaps demons as well. All these entities have desires. Machines have desires. Why foreground human desires and aspirations? The obvious answer is because we‚Äôre human. But that‚Äôs not enough for post-human philosophies. For Accelerationists, the aim is the liberation of What Technology Wants. Here‚Äôs a quote from a good write-up by Yuxi Lin at LessWrong:

    our world, with its cars, finances, AI, and other industrial technologies, has a clear goal of its own: a future dominated by more upgraded versions of these technologies, with humans becoming extinct or irrelevant.

You can come across this idea in Californian transhumanism / Extropianism too. It‚Äôs humans‚Äô glorious destiny to be supplanted by AI machines. But transhumanists typically imagine super-intelligent spiritual machines, far smarter than humans. It‚Äôs a worship of intelligence. With Accelerationism, at least in Land‚Äôs case, I get the feeling it‚Äôs more a misanthropic hatred of the human condition and a desire to annihilate consciousness and replace it with the machine. It‚Äôs philosophy as modish death-wish.

Pot noodles and black magic

The CCRU was an unconventional academic research centre. The Guardian‚Äôs Andy Beckett interviewed philosopher Iain Hamilton Grant, a former undergrad in the CCRU, who recalls how Land‚Äôs office became a CCRU hub:

    he had good drugs ‚Äî skunk [cannabis]. Although it could be grim going in there, once he started living in his office. There would be a tower of Pot Noodles and underwear drying on the radiator, which he had washed in the staff loos.",184,12 yr old jasmine smash accelerationist politician oxford 15 minute city protest original vid credit wtf tv wtf channel 12 yr old jasmine smash accelerationist satanic politician greed evil oxford 15 minute city gig accelerationism amphetamine philosophy death trip story dangerous idea word magical power heal harm ai charles manson dubstep neo nazi occultism lot amphetamine mainly nicholas land nick land 1990s 1993 techno feminist sadie plant set research unit philosophy department warwick university called cybernetic culture research unit ccru real academic centre large grant institutional status wa piece paper door name drew people vortex dominant influence ccru became 30 year old mid career researcher called nick land fan continental critical theorist like deleuze guattari george bataille land ccru mixed together cyberpunk science fiction cryptocurrency drug post humanism drained mesh continental theory created accelerationism guardian journalist andy beckett ha good definition accelerationists argue technology particularly computer technology capitalism particularly aggressive global variety massively sped intensified either best way forward humanity alternative accelerationists favour automation favour merging digital human often favour deregulation business drastically scaled back government believe people stop deluding economic technological progress controlled often believe social political upheaval ha value accelerationalism began life british cousin californian philosophy extropianism also began early 1990s wrote similar anarcho libertarianism hyper capitalism worship new technology expectation sudden leap beyond human california wa coventry accelerationism wa much darker nihilistic californian transhumanism land first book wa called thirst annihilation land ha said interest human liberation liberation human specie interested liberation mean production word accelerationism nothing expanding human potential wa californian self help wa liberating machine human accelerationism aimed push capitalism faster machine whirring round lifeless universe pure fordism ccru grew cybernetics sense human agent world full agent machine ecosystem dna perhaps demon well entity desire machine desire foreground human desire aspiration obvious answer human enough post human philosophy accelerationists aim liberation technology want quote good write yuxi lin lesswrong world car finance ai industrial technology ha clear goal future dominated upgraded version technology human becoming extinct irrelevant come across idea californian transhumanism extropianism human glorious destiny supplanted ai machine transhumanists typically imagine super intelligent spiritual machine far smarter human worship intelligence accelerationism least land case get feeling misanthropic hatred human condition desire annihilate consciousness replace machine philosophy modish death wish pot noodle black magic ccru wa unconventional academic research centre guardian andy beckett interviewed philosopher iain hamilton grant former undergrad ccru recall land office became ccru hub good drug skunk cannabis although could grim going started living office would tower pot noodle underwear drying radiator washed staff loo,7.0,0,True,

What if you could get all the things just 15 minutes away from home. Yes there is such a concept. Which is being considered for adoption in many countries and that concept is being known as 15-Minute City Concept.
The first talk of 15 Minute City was done by Professor Carlos Moreno of Sorbonne University in Paris in 2015. He said that if everything is made in one area only 15 minutes away, traffic rules will be less broken and people will drive less, then pollution. will also be less.

Alcohol Beyond This Point is a new podcast hosted by booze baron and lifetime entrepreneur Willows Christopher and operations extraordinaire Tyler Bergen; two young Canadian business guys who work out their problems with alcohol.

Herodotus, the Greek historian, reported that the ancient Persians tended to deliberate on important matters while they were drunk. They then reconsidered their decisions the following day when they were sober.

If it happened that their first deliberation took place when they were sober, they would always reconsider the matter under the influence of wine.  If a decision was approved both drunk and sober, the decision held; if not, the Persians set it aside.

Watch the Nebula exclusive, Great Cities: Central Park: https://nebula.tv/videos/citybeautiful-the-brilliant-design-of-new-yorks-central-park?ref=citynerd

If you're anything like me, you're already tired of how the ""15-minute city"" idea has been co-opted into the culture wars. It's really this simple: all things being equal, having more stuff that you need and want on a day-to-day basis within a reasonable walking distance is better than not having it. I suppose whatever argument there is is over what ""all things being equal"" consists of.

Today I take you on a tour of Valencia, Spain, and talk about how Valencians enjoy something more like a 5-minute city, probably without thinking about it (or even considering it argument-worthy) at all. Hope you enjoy!

nNnzdTexSXw,1,2023-03-05,Donald Trump Explains 15 Minute City. China Gives Warning.,"So much is happening in the world right now and there is no better time to take prepping and preparedness seriously. Recently Donald Trump has proposed his take on the new 15 minute city proposed to be built right here in America. More train derailments and not just in Ohio either. There have been train derailments in West Virginia, Alabama, and even Florida. Tensions are escalating between China and the United States as well. Other parties like Russia and North Korea are starting to flex their might. Can Biden keep the U.S. afloat with all of the signs pointing toward world war 3.  When was the last time that you could trust the government? Exactly, that's why you have to prepare because when the shtf, the government won't be there to bail us out. Now is the time to keep prepping and start prepping if you haven't already. We are indeed living in perilous times. #trainderailment #prepping #shtf #donaldtrump

b2p8L_VibAc,1,2023-03-05,What Are 15 Minute Cities? And Why Are People So Mad About Them?,"A lot of noise has been made in the UK and beyond about a looming threat to our personal freedoms. What has heralded this new concern about a dystopian project to forced us all to exist in narrowly defined areas? A combination of well intentioned, but perhaps poorly executed and poorly explained traffic reduction policies and a new-fangled city planning principle called 15 Minute Cities.

There have been protests, but I especially focus on the example of protests in Oxford as it's particularly interesting what people there have been upset about and I examine one of the most wild parliamentary speeches given in a long while by Nick Fletcher, MP for Don Valley and just how far removed from reality it is.

This video's intent isn't to persuade anyone who is already given to the conspiracy theories about 15 Minute Cities, but is about them. If you do believe the conspiracies and watch this, just bear that in mind as you go through it.

FQNsMTj2bdo,1,2023-03-05,What even are 15 minute cities and why should i care? #15MINUTECITIES #breadtube #communism,"This is a rather quickly thrown together explainer on the concept of the '15 Minute City' and a look at why there seems to be so much confusion and controversy around what is, on the face of it, a pretty mundane theory.

This was a last minute decision, and a fast write, record and edit process, due to the sheet amount of rightwing and 'honk for freedom' coverage I had seen pushed on facebook and twitter.

It is important that we on the left understand where this is coming from, why it is happening, and how to calmly communicate the truth when faced with seemingly bizarre theories about the World Economic Forum and Stalinist roadworks.

FSxdQefIzI0,1,2023-03-05,15 Minute Cities are Glorified Cities  |  Mugdha Pradhan  |  Functional Nutrition,"The idea of 15-minute cities is based on the concept of creating self-sufficient neighborhoods where residents can access most of their daily needs within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. This includes access to food, healthcare, education, work, and recreation facilities. 

But these 15-minute cities are ""glorified cages"" because they limit people's choices and experiences. There won't be any freedom to travel, no own currency, lack of diversity, limited mobility, and much more.

Do not give consent to these 15-minute cities. Do not agree to live in cages.

About Mugdha Pradhan:
Mugdha Pradhan CEO & Founder of iThrive, TedX speaker, Healer & Spiritual Coach.

In 2017 despite having a Master's in Nutrition when I struggled with my own personal health issues, learning the nuances of Functional Medicine transformed my health- from losing 37 kgs to reversing an autoimmune condition, healed myself. 

I moved from Canada to introduce Functional Nutrition for the first time in India through iThrive - Healing & Beyond 2019. My vision is to create healthier, happier, lifestyle disease-free communities across the world every single day.

With my expertise in Functional Nutrition, my ability to build strong teams and beautiful cultures, and my passion for scientific research and evidence-based work, iThrive has raised two rounds of funding so far.

I now not only help people solve their physical health issues but also complex mental, emotional, and spiritual health issues with an 'invite-only' program called Embracing The Human Experience.

Union Square:
Union Square is a 2.6-acre public plaza bordered by Geary, Powell, Post and Stockton Streets in downtown San Francisco, California. ""Union Square"" also refers to the central shopping, hotel, and theater district that surrounds the plaza for several blocks.[citation needed] The area got its name because it was once used for Thomas Starr King rallies and support for the Union Army during the American Civil War, earning its designation as a California Historical Landmark. Today, this one-block plaza and surrounding area is one of the largest collections of department stores, upscale boutiques, gift shops, art galleries, and beauty salons in the United States, making Union Square a major tourist destination and a well-known gathering place in downtown San Francisco. Grand hotels and small inns, as well as repertory, off-Broadway, and single-act theaters also contribute to the area's dynamic, 24-hour character. The Dewey Monument is at the center of Union Square. It is a statue of Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory

0cmdpNFvRk4,1,2023-03-12,What‚Äôs Wrong with 15-Minute Cities? Dror Poleg with Alain Bertaud,"Technology is forcing our cities to evolve. It is redefining the meaning of location and accessibility, it changes the way we work and move around, and it forces us to reconsider many of our basic assumptions. 

How should cities respond? What can be done to increase opportunity and tackle inequality? What is the connection between commuting, remote work, and overall prosperity? What should we make of all the trendy ideas that are currently being proposed?  And what‚Äôs so good about cities anyway?

Join me for a conversation with Alain Bertaud to find out. 

Alain Bertaud is one of the most influential voices on the topic of cities, urban labor markets, and urban transportation networks.

fXQiyW4mXD4,1,2023-03-26,15-Minute Cities: Explained.,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a city where everything you need is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride? That's the concept behind the 15-minute city, a new urban planning model that aims to create more livable and sustainable cities.

In this video, we'll explore what 15-minute cities are, how they work, and what benefits they can bring to urban areas. We'll dive into the history of the concept, tracing its roots back to the urban planning ideas of the 20th century. We'll also look at real-world examples of cities that are putting the 15-minute city model into practice, from Paris and Barcelona to Melbourne and Portland.

We'll examine the key elements of a 15-minute city, such as mixed-use zoning, walkability, public transit, and green spaces. We'll also discuss how the 15-minute city model can address issues like urban sprawl, traffic congestion, and social isolation.

Finally, we'll consider some of the challenges and limitations of the 15-minute city model. We'll discuss issues like affordability, access to services, and the need for community engagement and participation in the planning process.

Whether you're an urban planner, a city resident, or just curious about new ideas in urban design, this video will provide a comprehensive overview of the 15-minute city concept and its potential to transform the way we live in cities. So grab your bike and join us on a journey through the world of 15-minute cities!",1182,15 minute city explained ever wondered would like live city everything need within 15 minute walk bike ride concept behind 15 minute city new urban planning model aim create livable sustainable city video explore 15 minute city work benefit bring urban area dive history concept tracing root back urban planning idea 20th century also look real world example city putting 15 minute city model practice paris barcelona melbourne portland examine key element 15 minute city mixed use zoning walkability public transit green space also discus 15 minute city model address issue like urban sprawl traffic congestion social isolation finally consider challenge limitation 15 minute city model discus issue like affordability access service need community engagement participation planning process whether urban planner city resident curious new idea urban design video provide comprehensive overview 15 minute city concept potential transform way live city grab bike join u journey world 15 minute city,40.0,13,False,

MsjKlB2iGPs,1,2023-03-26,"15 minute cities, bike lanes, stack pack,","The ""15-minute city"" concept is gaining popularity in urban planning circles. It envisions a city where all of life's essential needs can be met within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from home. Bike paths are essential to this vision, providing safe and accessible routes for people to get around without relying on cars. By prioritizing bike infrastructure, cities can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote healthy and active lifestyles.

In addition to being a practical transportation solution, bike paths offer many environmental benefits. They reduce carbon emissions and help to mitigate the effects of climate change. They can also promote biodiversity by creating green corridors and habitats for wildlife.

However, building bike paths can be challenging, especially in established cities with limited space. It requires collaboration between government agencies, urban planners, and local communities to identify the most suitable routes and allocate resources for construction and maintenance. But the benefits are clear: cities prioritizing bike infrastructure can create healthier, more livable communities for everyone.    WHO IS ClevelandMarko?

zkQfgF21QU8,1,2023-03-26,The Future of Urban Living: Exploring the 15-Minute City Model,"In this video, we explore the concept of the 15-minute city and its potential advantages and disadvantages. The 15-minute city is a model for sustainable urbanism that aims to create neighbourhoods where all essential services and amenities are within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. 

By reducing car dependency and promoting sustainable modes of transportation, the 15-minute city has the potential to make cities more liveable and pedestrian-friendly, while also promoting social equity and local economic development. 

However, the model also poses challenges, such as the need for densification and careful planning and coordination among different sectors and stakeholders. We look at examples of cities that have adopted the 15-minute city model, including Paris and Melbourne, and discuss their successes and challenges.

QYQmVFV6iN0,1,2023-04-02,Our Expat Journey to Portugal - A 15-minute City if You Can Afford It,"If you live on the planet Earth, there's likely a housing crisis near you. It takes on many forms. In Portugal, it's a perfect storm of real estate speculation, tourist/expat desires, and low wages. And other issues, too, including the methods the government is using to find a balance among the needs of various stakeholders.

I cannot, and do not, claim to have a good handle on this issue yet. I'm working on it. And I should work on it -- and be mindful of it -- as a resident of Portugal.

I intend this series to be creative nonfiction, also known as narrative nonfiction. It is not my intention to specifically teach anything about the process of emigrating to Portugal. There may well be lessons to learn from our story, but my primary purpose is to tell our story. I think there is much value in connecting with such a story as you wonder and plan about your own journey. Or, perhaps, you may simply find this entertaining. Upon arrival in Portugal, I will continue to tell our story, but I will begin to mix in travel narratives as we explore the country and Europe.

I am a retired professor of media and journalism from Missouri State University. I am a full-time documentary filmmaker as of mid December 2022. As part of my work with students, I co-founded the documentary film studio Carbon Trace Productions (link below) -- a nonprofit organization dedicated to documentary education and humanitarian service.

Peterson discusses how Google attempted to collude with the Ontario government to turn Toronto's New Port development into a smart city and the concerns around the data generated by constant monitoring. He also talks about the 15-minute city plan proposed by the C40 consortium of municipalities, which aims to reduce caloric consumption and limit travel outside of neighborhoods, and the potential for top-down surveillance systems in places like China. Peterson also discusses the concept of smart cities and the concerns around complete control and the loss of privacy. The video includes personal anecdotes from Peterson's travels in China and his observations of the implementation of smart city technology there. Overall, the video provides a critical examination of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the 15-minute city and smart city concepts.

Bruges is often called the ""Venice of the North"" because of its extensive network of canals that flow through the city.
The historic center of Bruges is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, thanks to its well-preserved medieval architecture and urban design.

Bruges is famous for its chocolate, with dozens of chocolatiers throughout the city producing handmade pralines, truffles, and other sweet treats.

The city's iconic Belfry tower, which dates back to the 13th century, has 366 steps and offers stunning panoramic views of Bruges and the surrounding countryside.

Bruges is home to several important art museums, including the Groeningemuseum, which houses a collection of Flemish Primitives, and the Memling Museum, which showcases the works of the renowned Flemish painter Hans Memling.

The 15-minute city is an urban planning concept created by Carlos Moreno, further developed in his research work leading the Chaire ETI - IAE Paris Sorbonne School, that proposes that most of the needs and services of citizens should be within a 15-minute distance from any point in the city.

CityCompass incorporates an exclusive 15-minute city algorithm that, using our real-time accessibility calculation system, suggests the location of new amenities to make the study area more compact and functional. The result is a more livable, sustainable, and enjoyable city for its residents, where everything you need is just 15 minutes away. This means less time in traffic and more time to enjoy your daily activities.

3eVS10trwI0,1,2023-04-09,Cars Will Be Banned by 2030 Under WEF 15 Minute City Plans: 'Travel Is Not a Human Right',"The World Economic Forum has demanded that world governments begin to phase out car ownership with a view to completely banning cars for everyone in the future except people with exceptional social credit scores. And when you read between the lines regarding what they mean by that, they are clearly referring to themselves, the elite, as the only people who will be allowed to operate cars in the future.

Plus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in on the importance of the media asking tough questions ‚Äî ironic, given his repeated refusal to answer Rebel News' and others tough questions.
And finally, Ottawa is the latest city to embrace the 15 Minute City scheme, and like always, it's less about convenience and more about gaining power.

82MnIuJvCzo,1,2023-04-16,"No, 15-Minute Cities Will Not Take Away Your Freedom (And The Conspiracies Are WRONG!!!)","""But, but where am I gonna perk my ker? it's just an excuse to control us! It's Communism!!!""

15-minute cities, or just simply cities is something that existed since well, the beginning cities. They were places that were within a 15-minute walkable distance. And the United States of America had one of the most walkable cities in the world along with the most exquisite chef's kiss like public transit. that all changed after World War II, where the automobile started becoming the center of transportation. it seemed good at first, but now it has caused so many problems, like financial problems, problems with emotional and physical health, etc.

It seems like it's a foreign concept for Americans that they think putting things that close to each other, like stores, parks, housing, etc., close together is... just simply not American. well, one example I mentioned is in Oxford, UK, but still. it seems that the automobile has consumed most of our lifestyles, and that's not good. it's not our fault either. with generations of car lobbying, I'm sure I would've been like that too!

But yeah, it's basically just making cities more walkable, and although conspiracy theories have been on the rise (along with every stupid conspiracy theory since post-COVID), I can kind of see where they are coming from since I think they're setting up road filters throughout the City of Oxford. I think it's just better to build things close together, and upzone. those are better alternatives than just, adding road filters, cameras, etc. like if you really don't want people going through there, just block it off. 

but yeah, enjoy the video from an urban planner, that's not an urban planner.

(correction): I think there was 5 areas in oxford for the 15-minute city plan, I think the center one was like the city center. I don't know if that matters, but yeah, you get the whole jist.

8ZOFWEScNZM,1,2023-04-16,Il ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù delle citt√†? | Maurizio Milano,"‚Äú15-minute city‚Äù, ovvero la ‚Äúcitt√† da 15 minuti‚Äù. √à il progetto, proposto dall‚Äôurbanista franco-colombiano Carlos Moreno, docente alla Sorbona, e reso popolare nel 2020 dal sindaco di Parigi, Anne Hidalgo. L‚Äôidea √® suggestiva: rendere le grandi citt√† pi√π vivibili, suddividendole in distretti al cui interno le persone troveranno tutto ci√≤ ‚Äúdi cui hanno bisogno‚Äù.  Il progetto si inserisce all‚Äôinterno del pi√π ambio concetto di ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù, la ‚Äúcitt√† intelligente‚Äù del futuro nella quale la digitalizzazione e l‚Äôuso delle moderne tecnologie, dall‚Äôintelligenza artificiale alle ICT (Tecnologie dell‚Äôinformazione e della comunicazione), creeranno le condizioni per ridurre gli spostamenti fisici delle persone. All‚Äôinterno del proprio quartiere ci si potr√† muovere a piedi, in bicicletta, con mezzi pubblici o, all‚Äôoccorrenza, con mezzi elettrici in sharing. Gli spostamenti al di fuori del proprio distretto con mezzi privati non elettrici saranno sottoposti a monitoraggio, e possibili limitazioni. Il progetto √® in fase di sperimentazione a Oxford, e ha sollevato forti proteste popolari: il limite massimo agli spostamenti √® stato fissato a 100 uscite annuali dal proprio distretto, monitorate con telecamere e soggetto a sanzioni.
Il tema √®: chi definisce ci√≤ ‚Äúdi cui le persone hanno bisogno‚Äù, chi definisce i distretti e i limiti di spostamento?

We29jzwglPU,1,2023-04-16,Can Cherry Creek Become a True '15-Minute City'?,"It‚Äôs Cherry Creek Week, Day Four!






The story of Cherry Creek is the story of big dreams, yet with each exciting new project, the clash of old vs. new continues. Today, we‚Äôre examining what one developer has planned for that abandoned sea of parking lots just to the west of the mall. Amy Cara talks with host Bree Davies about her vision for Cherry Creek West  (https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2022/12/08/cherry-creek-west-development-denver) ‚Äî what could be multiple towers of offices, housing, retail, and some needed green space.¬†






Then we (virtually) travel all the way to the outskirts of Washington D.C. to check out Tysons (https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/tysons/comprehensive-plan)  ‚Äî a suburban mall formerly surrounded by parking lots, much like our beloved Cherry Creek. Tysons is well on its way to becoming a true 15-minute city, where thousands of people can live, walk, ride, roll, and take the train anywhere they need to go in no more than 15 minutes. Bree talks to an insider with the Tysons project, Justin Schor, to get some insight on how density can be done right.¬†

Now, what they're slamming us with is these 15-minute cities. Make no mistake. It's not about your convenience,‚Äù argues Christine Anderson. She‚Äôs a member of the European Parliament, representing the Alternative for Germany Party. 

Anderson was one of the European Parliament‚Äôs most vocal critics of COVID-19 policies in Europe, Canada, and beyond. 

Western democracies are gradually moving towards digital tyranny, she argues. The next step? Climate lockdowns. 

‚ÄúOnce we end up in a totalitarian regime and it's fully blown, given the technological means they have at their disposal today, we're not talking about 30 years of GDR [German Democratic Republic], 40 years of GDR. We're not talking about 70 years of the Soviet Union. We're talking about a very, very long time. That's what you should fear,‚Äù Anderson says.

#opiniaproduction #KlausSchwab #orasulde15minute

Ora»ôul de 15 minute (15-minute city) este un concept de planificare urbanƒÉ dezvoltat √Æncep√¢nd cu anul 2010 de columbianul Carlos Moreno, √Æn prezent profesor √Æn Fran»õa, concept √Æn care ‚Äûmajoritatea necesitƒÉ»õilor »ôi serviciilor zilnice, cum ar fi munca, educa»õia, cumpƒÉrƒÉturile, √Ængrijirea sƒÉnƒÉtƒÉ»õii »ôi petrecerea timpului liber, pot fi u»ôor accesibile printr-o plimbare pe jos de 15 minute sau printr-o plimbare cu bicicleta, din orice punct al ora»ôului.‚Äù 
Conceptul a c√¢»ôtigat interesul, √Æn primul r√¢nd, al primarului Parisului, Anne Hidalgo, apoi al unui grup de aproape 100 de primari de mari ora»ôe din intreaga lume!
AceastƒÉ nouƒÉ paradigmƒÉ √Æn dezvoltarea ora»ôului ar fi una cu adevƒÉrat revolu»õionarƒÉ, care ar contrazice teoria lui Wolf Schneider, din cartea apƒÉrutƒÉ √Æn anul 1968 ‚Äì Omniprezentul Babilon ‚Äì Ora»ôul ca destin al oamenilor de la Ur la Utopia, cƒÉ √Æn istoria multimilenarƒÉ a ora»ôelor lumii principiile de dezvoltare urbanƒÉ au rƒÉmas √Æn esen»õƒÉ acelea»ôi ‚Äì strƒÉvechiul Babilon devenind prototipul absolut al dezvoltƒÉrii metropolitane! 
Ora»ôele care aleg sƒÉ meargƒÉ pe aceasta nouƒÉ linie de dezvoltare propun ca, p√¢nƒÉ √Æn anul 2050, 85% din popula»õia planetei sƒÉ fie mutatƒÉ √Æn astfel de Smart Cities! AceastƒÉ abordare √Æ»ôi propune sƒÉ fie una inovatoare, care sƒÉ reducƒÉ dependen»õa de autovehicule, sƒÉ promoveze o via»õƒÉ mai sƒÉnƒÉtoasƒÉ »ôi sƒÉ conducƒÉ la o dezvoltare durabilƒÉ,  √ÆmbunƒÉtƒÉ»õind bunƒÉstarea »ôi calitatea vie»õii pentru locuitorii ora»ôului. 
Pentru designerii transumani»ôti ai Forumului Economic Mondial precum Klaus Schwab sau Yuval Noah Harari, ‚ÄûOrasul de 15 minute‚Äù este solu»õia perfectƒÉ pentru rezolvarea problemelor omenirii.
Toate acestea au st√¢rnit, a»ôa cum era de a»ôteptat, o adevƒÉratƒÉ furtunƒÉ a teoriilor conspira»õioniste! De»õinerea de autoturisme sau de proprietƒÉ»õi personale devenind inoportunƒÉ: guvernul va aloca tuturor un venit minim global, cu condi»õia unui control extins din partea autoritƒÉ»õilor »ôi a restr√¢ngerii unor drepturi civile ‚Äì ca sƒÉ ie»ôi din matricea care √Æ»õi este repartizatƒÉ »õi-ar trebui motive √Æntemeiate, aprobarea autoritƒÉ»õilor, recunoa»ôtere facialƒÉ. Dar de ce sƒÉ mai cƒÉlƒÉtore»ôti? Ai entertainment prin internetul metropolitan, m√¢ncare gratis... 
P√¢nƒÉ la urmƒÉ, ce este adevƒÉrat »ôi ce nu este adevƒÉrat √Æn acest nou proiect de revitalizare a ora»ôelor? Aceasta av√¢nd √Æn vedere cƒÉ ultimii 10 ani au demostrat un declin fƒÉrƒÉ precedent al megaora»ôelor: supraaglomerate, cu locuin»õe tot mai scumpe (√Æn Tokyo, cel mai ieftin apartament cu 3 camere a depƒÉ»ôit un milion de dolari), cu o calitate a vie»õii tot mai scƒÉzutƒÉ »ôi cu locuri de muncƒÉ tot mai √ÆndepƒÉrtate de zonele de reziden»õƒÉ! 
Sunt mai multe zone ale lumii unde, dezamƒÉgi»õi de via»õa de ora»ô, oamenii iau drumul localitƒÉ»õilor tot mai mici »ôi tot mai √ÆndepƒÉrtate de metropole! Pandemia de Covid 19 a accelerat fenomenul! √éntoarcere spre naturƒÉ este privitƒÉ ca fiind adevƒÉrata solu»õie! 
√én Rom√¢nia, conform ultimului recensƒÉm√¢nt, aproape toate ora»ôele sunt √Æntr-o scƒÉdere abruptƒÉ de popula»õie! Site-uri ca ‚ÄûVia»õa fƒÉrƒÉ ceas‚Äù, cu o vizibilitate tot mai mare, promoveazƒÉ intensiv pƒÉrƒÉsirea marilor ora»ôe √Æn favoare localitƒÉ»õilor mici, locuirea la casƒÉ cu grƒÉdinƒÉ, cultivarea propriilor legume, fƒÉrƒÉ chimicale »ôi √Æntotdeauna proaspete! Astfel este promovatƒÉ o via»õƒÉ de calitate »ôi, nu √Æn ultimul r√¢nd, o diminuare a depende»õei de tot felul de utilitƒÉ»õi »ôi o limitare a controlului autoritƒÉ»õilor! O via»õƒÉ mai simplƒÉ, dar mai plinƒÉ de con»õinut!
»òi totu»ôi, ce sƒÉ alegem? 
√én Biblie, ora»ôele mari sunt fost prezentate ca un simbol al arogan»õei, al corup»õiei, al imoralitƒÉ»õii, al brutalitƒÉ»õii, al criminalitƒÉ»õii, al inechitƒÉ»õilor sociale »ôi, mai ales, al idolatriei! Nu sunƒÉ cunoscut? Babilonul, Sodoma, Gomora, Ninive, Damascul »ôi chiar Ierusalimul au »ôocat istoria prin cruzimea »ôi prin arogan»õa lor! Nu √Ænt√¢mplƒÉtor mesajul Bibliei este ‚Äì ‚ÄûIe»ôi»õi din Babilon, poporul Meu‚Ä¶‚Äù (Apocalipsa 18:1-4).

127iFAxFu1U,1,2023-04-23,Il Great Reset delle citt√†,"‚Äú15-minute city‚Äù, ovvero la ‚Äúcitt√† da 15 minuti‚Äù. √à il progetto, proposto dall‚Äôurbanista franco-colombiano Carlos Moreno, docente alla Sorbona, e reso popolare nel 2020 dal sindaco di Parigi, Anne Hidalgo. L‚Äôidea √® suggestiva: rendere le grandi citt√† pi√π vivibili, suddividendole in distretti al cui interno le persone troveranno tutto ci√≤ ‚Äúdi cui hanno bisogno‚Äù. Il progetto si inserisce all‚Äôinterno del pi√π ambio concetto di ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù, la ‚Äúcitt√† intelligente‚Äù del futuro nella quale la digitalizzazione e l‚Äôuso delle moderne tecnologie, dall‚Äôintelligenza artificiale alle ICT (Tecnologie dell‚Äôinformazione e della comunicazione), creeranno le condizioni per ridurre gli spostamenti fisici delle persone. All‚Äôinterno del proprio quartiere ci si potr√† muovere a piedi, in bicicletta, con mezzi pubblici o, all‚Äôoccorrenza, con mezzi elettrici in sharing. Gli spostamenti al di fuori del proprio distretto con mezzi privati non elettrici saranno sottoposti a monitoraggio, e possibili limitazioni. Il progetto √® in fase di sperimentazione a Oxford, e ha sollevato forti proteste popolari: il limite massimo agli spostamenti √® stato fissato a 100 uscite annuali dal proprio distretto, monitorate con telecamere e soggetto a sanzioni.
Il tema √®: chi definisce ci√≤ ‚Äúdi cui le persone hanno bisogno‚Äù, chi definisce i distretti e i limiti di spostamento? Non vi √® il rischio che ci√≤ che nasce come un diritto naturale diventi un ‚Äúpermesso‚Äù, concesso, modulato o ritirato a discrezione dell‚Äôautorit√† pubblica? Dai lockdown sanitari ai lockdown climatici? √à presto per dirlo, ma preoccupa il giro mentale soggiacente a questi progetti, non a caso in forte accelerazione post-CoViD e oggetto di molte discussioni a Davos. Un motivo in pi√π per preoccuparsi‚Ä¶

Fifteen minute cities have been in the headlines over the past couple of months - either through excess of marketing (as if it's a new concept) or through excess of bureaucratic zeal combined with misunderstandings and hubris - such as the one seen in Oxford.

Before this controversy, there was ""smart cities"" - a combination of tech grift, some relatively useful but minor stuff and, yes, some authoritarian nonsense.

So what are 15 minute smart cities? Are they dangerous? Will they go wrong? Or it's just a case study of conspiracy paranoia?

Luckily, I live in a 15 minute smart city!

Let's explore!

NWDU6Z6pNqE,1,2023-04-30,"Exit and Build is the Antidote to 15-Minute Cities, Banking Collapse, and the Great Reset","You may have heard about 15-minute cities and smart cities. They sound great, right? Everything you need within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. But what they don't tell you is that these cities are designed to monitor and control you every step of the way. We're talking about facial recognition cameras, tracking devices, and data collection on a massive scale. If you're anything like me, that's not the kind of future you want.

So, what's the solution? Exit and build! 

We need to start thinking outside the box and take action to protect our way of life. We need to invest in land and become self-sufficient in food and resources. We need to use alternative currencies that can't be manipulated by the banks. We need to take control of our lives and build a better future for ourselves and our families.

But it's not just about survival. It's also about thriving. 

At the Exit and Build Land Summit, we'll be exploring practical ways to build a more resilient and self-sufficient future. We'll be sharing ideas and strategies for homesteading, permaculture, and alternative living arrangements. Whether you're a seasoned prepper or just getting started, there's something for everyone.

RESISTANCE RISES AGAINST 15 MINUTE CITIES AND LTNS!  (THE WEST FALLS AS THE EAST RISES - EXTRACT)

 @ThomasLuongo  , Alex Krainer, Alexander Mercouris of  @TheDuran  and I discuss the growing resistance to LTNs, 15 minute cities and the WEF's Great Reset agenda.
This is an extract from a much larger conversation that looks at these issues at a much larger macro level.

I have been running my YouTube channel since April 2017. I post pretty much everyday, focusing on projects I like and am connected to. Many of these are smaller projects, more suited for the smaller investor and for those seeking out the next Solana.  I have a particular interest in privacy focused cryptos some of which I cover regularly.  

I often build long-term relationships with projects, getting to know them and their communities. I conduct my interviews in an easy going, naturalistic manner, placing an emphasis on the relationships that I build.

Projects I have covered often and regularly include: Pirate Chain, Electroneum, Morpheus Network, Veruscoin, Komodo, Etho Protocol, Sentinel, Tube, Signum (formerly Burst), Spectre, Secret Network, Skycoin, Osmosis, Cosmos, and occasionally, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Monero. Dreams Quest, Nightlife Crypto and Near Protocol are a few projects that I have recently started covering. (September 2021)

Fk4ce7l1a_U,1,2023-05-07,15-Minute Cities: Climate-Lockdown Dystopias?,"15-minute cities are a concept that have gained popularity around the world as mayors and city councils try to cut down on the amount of fossil fuels used by city residents. The idea is to have all necessities within a 15-minute commute of a person's home, which would cut down on the need to drive long distances on a daily basis. Sounds great, right? Well, let's just say it's not as rosy as it sounds.

Christine Anderson: From 15-Minute Cities to Climate Lockdowns, the Rise of Digital Tyranny?

‚ÄúThe Digital Green Certificate, the COVID pass, that was a test balloon to get people to [have] to produce some kind of a QR code, just getting people used to that. Now, what they're slamming us with is these 15-minute cities. Make no mistake. It's not about your convenience,‚Äù argues Christine Anderson. She‚Äôs a member of the European Parliament, representing the Alternative for Germany Party. 

Anderson was one of the European Parliament‚Äôs most vocal critics of COVID-19 policies in Europe, Canada, and beyond. 

Western democracies are gradually moving towards digital tyranny, she argues. The next step? Climate lockdowns. 

‚ÄúOnce we end up in a totalitarian regime and it's fully blown, given the technological means they have at their disposal today, we're not talking about 30 years of GDR [German Democratic Republic], 40 years of GDR. We're not talking about 70 years of the Soviet Union. We're talking about a very, very long time. That's what you should fear,‚Äù Anderson says.

Walkability, proximity, or maybe density? Sure, those are the core ideas, but social equity is what's truly at the heart of the 15-Minute City philosophy. 

We'll explore how this concept benefits everyone and creates a better future for all of us. So, join me on this journey where urban planning meets community empowerment.

fH3czFOooeY,1,2023-05-07,"How bikes can unlock transit, housing and climate (but only when it's safe) - Lindsay Sturman","Bikes are our happiest form of transportation ‚Äì we love to bike, we go on vacation to bike ‚Äì it‚Äôs joyful, meditative, healthy, relaxing, and free. Bikes also scale transit ‚Äì they provide that crucial first mile/last mile connection ‚Äì and in many cities, without it, transit cannot scale. But despite all this, when it comes to installing bike lanes, people fight them with the fire of 1000 suns ‚Äì even people who love to bike. But if we can find our way through the anger and anxiety,  bikes can unlock car-free living, which unlocks parking-free housing, which is the key to naturally occurring affordable housing. Bikes also unlock the dream of urbanists everywhere ‚Äì a true functional 15 minute city. Imagine living in SoCal and never needing a car‚Ä¶ walking or biking or triking along a street of neighborhood serving retail ‚Äì to get groceries, run errands, or get to the Metro. More money in your pocket, and better health and mental health. The good news is: all the evidence says it is possible ‚Äì if we can just take a leap of faith ‚Äì and build truly safe bike infrastructure. And as appealing as this may sound ‚Äì we also need to do it for climate. To meet our climate goals for transportation emissions reduction, we need to reduce the number of cars ‚Äì meaning walking and transit ‚Äì but transit needs bikes. So it turns out that the key to addressing three of our biggest challenges ‚Äì climate, traffic and housing ‚Äì is the lowly bike.

Das Evangelium / Die Gute Botschaft:
1.Korinther 15,1-4
Ich tue euch aber, Br√ºder, das Evangelium kund, das ich euch verk√ºndigt habe, das ihr auch angenommen habt, in dem ihr auch steht, durch das ihr auch gerettet werdet, wenn ihr festhaltet, mit welcher Rede ich es euch verk√ºndigt habe, es sei denn, dass ihr vergeblich zum Glauben gekommen seid. Denn ich habe euch vor allem √ºberliefert, was ich auch empfangen habe: dass Christus f√ºr unsere S√ºnden gestorben ist nach den Schriften; und dass er begraben wurde und dass er auferweckt worden ist am dritten Tag nach den Schriften;
R√∂mer 10,9-11
Denn wenn du mit deinem Mund Jesus als den Herrn bekennst und in deinem Herzen glaubst, dass Gott ihn aus den Toten auferweckt hat, so wirst du gerettet. Denn mit dem Herzen glaubt man, um gerecht zu werden, und mit dem Mund bekennt man, um gerettet zu werden; denn die Schrift spricht: ¬ªJeder, der an ihn glaubt, wird nicht zuschanden werden!¬´

Urban planning and design play a crucial role in shaping the quality of life within communities. Over time, various concepts have emerged to improve accessibility, reduce commuting time, and enhance the overall livability of cities and towns. Three such concepts that have gained traction in recent years are the 5-minute town, 10-minute city, and 15-minute city. Each of these ideas centers around the principle of creating self-sufficient communities where residents can access essential services, amenities, and opportunities within a short distance, thereby reducing dependence on private vehicles and long commutes. In this article, we will explore the meanings of these concepts, their implications, and the potential benefits they bring to urban environments.

The 5-Minute Town 

The 5-minute town is a concept that envisions a self-contained community where residents can access most of their daily needs within a five-minute walk or bike ride from their homes. Essential services such as schools, grocery stores, healthcare facilities, parks, and workplaces are strategically located in close proximity, fostering a compact and walkable environment. By minimizing the distance between homes and amenities, the 5-minute town aims to reduce commuting time, traffic congestion, and carbon emissions while enhancing social interaction and community cohesion. This concept promotes active transportation, such as walking and cycling, as viable modes of commuting. Additionally, mixed-use zoning encourages a vibrant and diverse neighborhood where people of different backgrounds can live, work, and play in the same area. The 5-minute town concept not only prioritizes accessibility but also fosters a sense of belonging and well-being among its residents.

The 10-Minute City

Expanding on the principles of the 5-minute town, the 10-minute city takes the concept a step further by offering a broader range of amenities and services within a ten-minute radius of residential areas. In addition to the facilities available in a 5-minute town, a 10-minute city includes cultural institutions, recreational spaces, entertainment venues, and higher education facilities, all within walking or cycling distance. By providing a wider range of options and opportunities, the 10-minute city aims to reduce the need for long-distance commuting and promote local economic development. This concept emphasizes the importance of density and mixed-use zoning to create vibrant and dynamic neighborhoods. The 10-minute city also advocates for a well-connected and efficient public transportation system that enables residents to travel easily between different parts of the city, further reducing reliance on private vehicles. By incorporating sustainable practices and ensuring equitable access to amenities, the 10-minute city aims to enhance residents' quality of life, foster social inclusivity, and support a thriving urban environment.

The 15-Minute City
The 15-minute city is an urban planning concept that strives to create self-sufficient neighborhoods where residents can meet their daily needs within a fifteen-minute radius. Building on the principles of the 5-minute town and the 10-minute city, this concept aims to provide a comprehensive range of amenities, services, and employment opportunities within close proximity to residential areas. In a 15-minute city, residents can access schools, healthcare facilities, retail stores, restaurants, parks, cultural centers, recreational spaces, and workplaces within a short distance, thereby minimizing the need for long commutes. The concept promotes a diverse and mixed-use urban fabric that encourages a balance between living, working, and leisure activities. By reducing travel distances and enhancing walkability, cycling infrastructure, and public transportation, the 15-minute city aims to improve residents' quality of life, reduce congestion and",2523,people receiving warning mail five min neighborhood 15 min city 10 min town understanding concept 5 minute town 10 minute city 15 minute city urban planning design play crucial role shaping quality life within community time various concept emerged improve accessibility reduce commuting time enhance overall livability city town three concept gained traction recent year 5 minute town 10 minute city 15 minute city idea center around principle creating self sufficient community resident access essential service amenity opportunity within short distance thereby reducing dependence private vehicle long commute article explore meaning concept implication potential benefit bring urban environment 5 minute town 5 minute town concept envisions self contained community resident access daily need within five minute walk bike ride home essential service school grocery store healthcare facility park workplace strategically located close proximity fostering compact walkable environment minimizing distance home amenity 5 minute town aim reduce commuting time traffic congestion carbon emission enhancing social interaction community cohesion concept promotes active transportation walking cycling viable mode commuting additionally mixed use zoning encourages vibrant diverse neighborhood people different background live work play area 5 minute town concept prioritizes accessibility also foster sense belonging well among resident 10 minute city expanding principle 5 minute town 10 minute city take concept step offering broader range amenity service within ten minute radius residential area addition facility available 5 minute town 10 minute city includes cultural institution recreational space entertainment venue higher education facility within walking cycling distance providing wider range option opportunity 10 minute city aim reduce need long distance commuting promote local economic development concept emphasizes importance density mixed use zoning create vibrant dynamic neighborhood 10 minute city also advocate well connected efficient public transportation system enables resident travel easily different part city reducing reliance private vehicle incorporating sustainable practice ensuring equitable access amenity 10 minute city aim enhance resident quality life foster social inclusivity support thriving urban environment 15 minute city 15 minute city urban planning concept strives create self sufficient neighborhood resident meet daily need within fifteen minute radius building principle 5 minute town 10 minute city concept aim provide comprehensive range amenity service employment opportunity within close proximity residential area 15 minute city resident access school healthcare facility retail store restaurant park cultural center recreational space workplace within short distance thereby minimizing need long commute concept promotes diverse mixed use urban fabric encourages balance living working leisure activity reducing travel distance enhancing walkability cycling infrastructure public transportation 15 minute city aim improve resident quality life reduce congestion,349.0,86,False,

Songdo City in South Korea was built as a smart city, much like a 15-minute city. But it has caused unexpected problems that can not be easily addressed. In this video, I explore those problems and then elaborate on my concerns about the 15-minute city concept. The concept should only be used as a reference for urban planning. If not, the consequences might be dire.

Something the hosts have wanted to do for quite some time, they kick things off by exploring the groundbreaking construction tech investment by EllisDon, a leading Canadian-based general contracting company investing in construction tech startups. They highlight the potential impact of this move on project efficiency and sustainability and its influence on fostering a culture of innovation within the industry. Moving on, they take a deep dive into the world of robots on the jobsite, focusing on SuperDroid Robotics and their cutting-edge and economically priced robots designed for construction sites. They discuss the advantages and applications of these robots, along with potential challenges and the future prospects of this technology. Lastly, the hosts tackle the somewhat polarizing topic of the 15-minute city, examining both sides of the debate and discussing the benefits, challenges, and potential for hybrid models. Tune in most Tuesdays to the Weekly Site Report for more engaging discussions around construction, culture, and the built world.

It aims to create a futuristic urban environment that houses up to 9 million people. The city is planned to be a singular long building, around 500 meters tall, with a mirrored facade and a width of only 200 meters. The Line will rely on vertical layering to provide homes, offices, green spaces, and public schools, along with year-round climate control. It aims to be a 5-minute city, where all amenities are within walking distance and connected by a high-speed rail system. The city will be powered by clean energy and is expected to reach net-zero emissions. However, the project has raised concerns regarding environmental impact, social displacement, and privacy issues due to its surveillance-oriented approach. Its success and realization remain to be seen.

M5g_1eRbrTM,1,2023-06-04,Electric Cars Under Attack: The Shocking Truth About Climate Crusaders,"What are 15-minute cities and why are they controversial? 15-minute mega cities are being promoted by some as the future way we will live. How does this impact automotive and your vehicles. A new report makes it clear that the ultimate goal: tiny, uncomfortable apartments and bicycles for all. No cars at all. How is this, lets look at what they are saying an not my opinion.

The first goal is to replace all gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles, even though we do not have enough charging power to charge every car and sales are only at 6%. So people will have to give up their cars. That's the alarming conclusion of a new report from the University of California, Davis and ""a network of academics and policy experts"" called the Climate and Community Project. Why are the climate crusaders coming for your electric car as well.

The dirty little secret is that everyone will have to make do with much less-fewer cars, smaller houses and yards, and a significantly lower standard of living. Check out this report and the results that will shock you.

6xNLY6WWLHg,1,2023-06-04,Earth Day Pt 2 - 15 Minute City Protest with XR Scientist,"What is science but investigations, measurements and conclusions that are open to revision?

It's probably more than that I am no scientist after all. However this real life scientist accepts science and doesn't question it or it's source.

Our debate gets heated when after listenning to her for 10 minutes, she constantly interrupts me. I'd certainly woken up on the wrong side of my mate's couch that morning and was in no mood to be shouted down by ignorance.

I should have kept my cool better though and will try my best to do so in the future.

I am glad that I pushed this haughty scientist however, as what she revealed is something all scientists and non-scientists alike should ponder. Do you really research the matters you care about or do you go with the first obvious convenient flow of information that you come across?

73ndM9i2a-c,1,2023-06-11,"Affordable Walkable Cities: Frederick, Maryland","Affordable Walkable Cities: Frederick, MD

We will look at cities that are just plain underrated. We will focus on specific neighborhoods that are walkable and bike-able to services and amenities within a reasonable distance. The 15 minute city in America?
 
What actually qualifies as Affordable? We will be looking at cities with average or below average rent and at or below the median home sale price. 

What qualifies as Walkable? The entire city doesn‚Äôt have to be walkable since that‚Äôs unrealistic but they must have at least several neighborhoods with a good walk, bike and transit score. The goal is to find an area within the city where you can absolutely live car free.

Frederick has a little bit of everything.  Mountains for Hiking and camping. Lakes and rivers for kayaking. Breweries and Wineries a-plenty, there‚Äôs always an event to find. Tons of good dining. I could go on and on. 

Frederick is located within an hour of Baltimore and Washington D.C.

Jesus is returning! Are you saved?

Jesus is God in flesh form. Jesus was born of a virgin. He died on a cross to save us from our sins. He led a perfect life to be the perfect sacrifice for you and me. He resurrected three days later to show His power over death! Jesus is the only way to Heaven. Time is short. Accept Jesus offer of salvation today.

Here are the ABC's for becoming a Christian. 

A - Admit - Admit to God that you are a sinner. Repent, turning away from your sin. ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23

B - Believe - Believe that Jesus is God's Son and accept God's gift of forgiveness from sin. ""While we were sinners, Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 

C - Confess - Confess your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord. ""If you will confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved."" Romans 10:9 

Here is a prayer you can pray to God if you like. Dear God, thank You for choosing to love me! I know I am a sinner. I believe You sent Your Son, Jesus Christ, to die for my sins. I believe He rose again and lives today. Today I open my heart and life to you and I receive you as my Lord and Savior.""  Thank You for Your wonderful love and for changing my life forever. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.

Here is a link to and online bible. I suggest you start with the book of John. Praying to God and reading the bible is how we get to Know Him and what He expects of us.

- 15 minute cities and what that means
- EMF dangers, cell phone dangers, WIFI dangers and more about how you can tell if you are electrohypersenstive
- Allergies and chronic sneezing and sicknesses and why it's probably more to do with what they are spraying in our skies
- and much more!

Smart Cities is a globalist project of the United Nations, also known as 15 Minute Cities is sold to inhabitants as all about the convenience of having all the services and amenities they need within 15 minutes of their homes.

The rally MC was Craig Cole from the Australia One Party. The rally travelled through the Berwick town centre which is a section of Princes Highway. Victoria Police were present to facilitate the rally route. 

The rally ended where it started in Pioneers Park where Craig Cole and Darren Bergwerf of My Place Frankston gave speeches. There are now over 200 My Place communities across Australia. Darren spoke about the need for local community activism. Craig stated the facts about Smart Cities and how they are already leading to restrictions on residents in cities in Europe and UK. Both spoke about the need for different freedom activist groups to unite and put aside their differences. They also called on attendees to spread the facts about Smart Cities to others.

hfTpiotfhls,1,2023-06-18,"031 - Thomas Walker-Werth: Free City Planning, Frontier Governance & Colonising Outer Space","Timothy Allen talks with Thomas Walker-Werth.

Today‚Äôs show was one of my favourite interviews from our recent trip to LibertyCon in Lisbon. Thomas is an associate editor at The Objective Standard, and as a former town planner in the UK he has much to say about the designing and organising of Free Cities. 

In this conversation, we take a deep dive into the reality of what its actually like planning towns as well as making some predictions about the prospect of designing places to live in outer space, particularly mars. Thomas has uniquely informed opinions on the morality and practice of governance in these future frontiers which, prior to our conversation was not something I had ever thought about before.

Other topics covered include: New urbanism, 15 minute cities, post modernism, flying cars, environmentalism, collectivism and we discuss the role that Elon Musk might play in the future of alternative governance models.

Enjoy the conversation.

IZghPX-V0G8,1,2023-06-18,15 minute cities | A disturbing reality,"Here Robert and Michael Ashley talk about 15-minute cities.

Full Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtvp8Jp1iMI

Michael Ashley, who co-authored the book ""Neuromined"" with Robert, joins him to discuss the future of humanity in the age of AI and politics. In this thought-provoking conversation, they explore the potential impact on society if governments were to use the power of AI to control narrative, movement, and our ability to speak freely. Using recent examples of Western governments moving in that direction, they highlight the disturbing actions of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when he created a false narrative around the Canadian trucker convoy and subsequently froze the bank accounts of anyone involved or seen to support it. They also discuss the implications of CBDC (programmable money) and how it would make it easier for governments to enact similar actions. The conversation then takes a fascinating turn toward the ""15-minute cities"" concept and how it might end up restricting the movement of people instead of providing convenience. They also talk about the rise of conspiracy theories and how they have been proven correct far too often in recent times. Furthermore, they delve into big tech, working with the government to control the ""narrative"" and influence how people vote and the looming threat of deep fakes and foreign governments using them to manipulate public trust. In summary, this podcast provides a valuable perspective on the future of humanity and the potential consequences of AI and political control.

Chris has now taken an interest in politics and will be running for Mayor of Toronto as, ""The People's Politician."" Inside we discuss his political platform, 15-minute cities, government spending, his qualifications, how he's been so accurate with his predictions in the past, and the meaning of his tattoos.

This is a different look at a man, ""built differently."" Like him or hate him, he definitely has something to say.

IYLz-afTOyM,1,2023-06-25,Pierce Corbyn Explains that ULEZ & 15 minute Cities are Illegal in the UK #youtubeshort,"Welcome back to our channel! Today's video is a real eye-opener. We're featuring none other than Pierce Corbyn once again, this time challenging the legality of two popular urban strategies in the UK - ULEZ (Ultra-Low Emission Zones) and '15 Minute Cities.'

The video, ""Pierce Corbyn Explains that ULEZ & 15 Minute Cities are Illegal in the UK,"" plunges into a compelling discussion that promises to reshape your understanding of these concepts. Corbyn presents a unique perspective, questioning not just the effectiveness, but the very legality of these approaches under UK law.

ULEZ and '15 Minute Cities' are urban planning strategies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability. The former seeks to minimize harmful vehicle emissions, while the latter envisions cities where everything a resident needs is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.

Pierce Corbyn, known for his contrarian views on climate change, presents his case on why these policies violate certain laws in the UK. He delves into the specific legal issues, examining the framework of UK law, the implications of these strategies, and the potential rights being overlooked.

This video encourages viewers to critically analyze the laws and policies that shape our urban environments and their sustainability initiatives. It's not just about accepting or rejecting a proposal but about understanding its full spectrum of impacts.

Please note that the views expressed in this video are those of Pierce Corbyn and do not necessarily reflect the position of our channel. We believe in promoting diverse perspectives to foster informed discussions.

If you find this video intriguing and thought-provoking, please give it a thumbs up, share it with your friends, and subscribe to our channel for more enlightening content.

v80aGKJF0BI,2,2023-07-02,"Affordable Walkable Cities: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","We will look at cities that are just plain underrated. We will focus on specific neighborhoods that are walkable and bike-able to services and amenities within a reasonable distance. The 15 minute city in America?
 
What actually qualifies as Affordable? We will be looking at cities with average rent and median home sale price. 

What qualifies as Walkable? The entire city doesn‚Äôt have to be walkable since that‚Äôs unrealistic but they must have at least several neighborhoods with a good walk, bike and transit score. The goal is to find an area within the city where you can absolutely live car free.

Walkable Neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA
Southside
Bloomfield
Lawrenceville

Pittsburgh is the perfect embodiment of affordable and walkable but I certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend living here if you don‚Äôt like french fries inside your sandwiches.

The city's geography is truly striking. Pittsburgh is characterized by its scenic hills and the convergence of three rivers: the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio. With iconic steel bridges that span its three rivers.
These bridges often feature pedestrian walkways, allowing pedestrians to access different neighborhoods.

Pittsburgh's light rail system, commonly known as the ""T,"" consists of two lines: the Red Line and the Blue Line. The light rail is an efficient mode of transportation for commuting within the city, and it also serves major destinations such as the stadiums, universities, and cultural institutions.

The ""15 minute city"" or ""walkable community"" is a current boogeyman for some, for me it's my daily life. Let's look around and see if it is as terrible as it sounds.

This isn't meant to imply that China is perfect and USA is terrible. Or that USA has no walkable communities and China only has them... it's mainly just to highlight the insanity of people who are anti 15 minute cities. Thanks

-bxzOXkD8PI,2,2023-07-09,Dalla citt√† a 15 minuti alle teorie del complotto,"La citt√† a 15 minuti √® un modello urbanistico che vuole cambiare le nostre citt√† rendendole pi√π omogenee, garantendo a ogni abitante l‚Äôaccesso a negozi, scuole, servizi essenziali e parchi nell‚Äôarco di 15 minuti.

 A piedi, in bici, o con mezzi pubblici. A teorizzarla √® stato l‚Äôurbanista Carlos Moreno, docente alla Sorbona e consigliere del sindaco di Parigi Anne Hidalgo. Nel corso dell‚Äôultimo anno, per√≤, il piano di Moreno √® finito risucchiato in diverse teorie cospiratorie che incrociano Davos, il ‚ÄúGrande Reset‚Äù, la paranoia contro i vaccini e l‚Äôinevitabile nuovo ordine globale. Carlos, di conseguenza, ha ricevuto diverse minacce, rendendo il suo lavoro pi√π pericoloso, a conferma dei forti attriti tra gli accademici e una minoranza di cospirazionisti.

Questo approfondimento a cura di Pietro Minto, giornalista ed esperto di cultura digitale chiarisce molti aspetti sulla tematica.

tiAHFvK-FaE,2,2023-07-16,Why the Upper West Side is the best neighborhood in New York City,"New York City, especially Manhattan, is very walkable and you can easily live without a car. Basically the only 15 minute city in the United States.

There are many great neighborhoods in NYC like Soho, the Lower East side, the Upper East Side, or the Financial District.

But a neighborhood in New York City that has remained relatively unchanged since WW2 is the Upper West Side. 

With Timeless architecture sandwiched between two iconic scenic parks, Central Park and Riverside Park. You can‚Äôt go wrong. 

So the next time you travel to New York City, stay in the best neighborhood - The Upper West Side. And from there you can explore all the other New York City Attractions and places to go.

I unfortunately didn't have the foresight to mention the cobbler who will fix your shoes when they fall apart, because hey, that never happens right? Well it did. And now my shoes are fixed up and good as new. Let's see how it plays out in a walkable community. 

And if you made it to the end, I did look it up. Seems it is decent?... If you've seen it,  should I watch the Adam Sandler Cobbler or was my experience here more than enough shoe repairmen for the day?

875bXvLegiM,2,2023-07-16,Climate Activists Want a Wartime Economy,"What does a ""Cuban Diet,"" have in common with carbon taxes, 15-minute cities, lockdowns and a War Measures Act?
The ""Climate Emergency,"" of course!  This is a presentation originally done by Michelle Stirling for the Stavely-Claresholm chapter of the Alberta Prosperity Project.  Michelle explains how climate activists are enamored with the thought of a wartime economy so they can ration everything you do or use, and how the concept of a climate lockdown - often said to be a 'conspiracy theory' is something that former UNFCCC executive director Yvo de Boer advocated for as far back as 2015!  How did a report titled ""Deadline 2020"" that was written in 2016, proposing that everyone have a personal carbon footprint of only 2.9 tonnes CO2 equivalent...how did COVID lockdowns affect the world's atmospheric concentration of CO2?  Immeasurable. Much less than the random seasonal fluctuations of CO2 concentration.  Michelle explains the source of concerns about a 'climate emergency' - the misuse of RCP8.5, promoted by green billionaires and ENGOs.  In fact, since 2014, we have known that CO2 is not the control knob that can fine tune climate - it does have a warming effect and a beneficial CO2 fertilization effect as well, meaning more plants.

What actually qualifies as Affordable? We will be looking at cities with average rent and median home sale price. 

What qualifies as Walkable? The entire city doesn‚Äôt have to be walkable since that‚Äôs unrealistic but they must have at least several neighborhoods with a good walk, bike and transit score. The goal is to find an area within the city where you can absolutely live car free.

These frameworks, traditionally employed in military and intelligence contexts, are now finding relevance in urban planning and security. As governments and intelligence agencies seek to understand the operational environment and gather critical information, it becomes crucial to assess how such knowledge can be misused and pose serious threats to the 15 Minute City concept.

Imagine the intricate web of a 15 Minute City, where every service, infrastructure, and organization is interconnected to provide residents with accessible and sustainable urban living. While this vision is undoubtedly transformative, it opens the door to malevolent actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise the city's integrity. Espionage by enemy nations, terrorist groups, or unethical entities could easily leverage ASCOPE and PMESII to identify crucial weak points, leading to the disruption and sabotage of critical services within the city.

The consequences of such compromises are dire and extend beyond just inconvenience. The fabric of society, transportation, healthcare, utilities, and information networks could be targeted, creating a domino effect of chaos and instability. Our dream of a harmonious 15 Minute City could turn into a nightmare if not adequately safeguarded against these emerging threats.

To preserve the integrity and vision of the 15 Minute City, proactive measures must be taken to mitigate the risks associated with ASCOPE and PMESII operations. Comprehensive risk assessments become paramount in identifying potential vulnerabilities unique to this urban context. This analysis should encompass not only physical aspects but also the ever-evolving cyber realm, where protecting critical digital infrastructure is of utmost importance.

Robust cybersecurity measures must be established, incorporating advanced encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. These digital fortifications form the front line in safeguarding against cyberattacks that could cripple essential systems within the city.

Enhanced surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities are indispensable tools in detecting and deterring suspicious activities. Utilizing advanced technologies such as video monitoring, biometrics, and data analytics can provide invaluable insights into potential threats within the city. Collaboration with intelligence agencies is crucial, as exchanging information can ensure real-time updates and vigilance against emerging risks.

Public awareness and education are equally vital in creating a resilient 15 Minute City. Instilling a culture of awareness among citizens and key stakeholders can encourage reporting of suspicious activities, thus forming a collective defense against potential threats. Implementing training programs and promoting responsible digital practices can minimize vulnerabilities and foster a united front against any malicious intent.

Moreover, addressing the complexity of the 15 Minute City requires a multidisciplinary approach. Government agencies, private sector entities, and research institutions must join forces to tackle security challenges collectively. Information sharing, conducting joint exercises, and leveraging diverse expertise can lead to the development of comprehensive security strategies, reinforcing the city's resilience against potential threats.

In conclusion, the realization of the 15 Minute City is a vision worth pursuing, offering the promise of sustainable and livable urban environments for all. However, we must confront the reality of potential risks posed by ASCOPE and PMESII operations. By embracing a proactive and multidimensional approach, we can ensure the safety and longevity of the 15 Minute City concept. Let us work together to preserve the vision of the World Economic Forum and create a future where accessible and efficient urban living flourishes, resilient against any adversary seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for their own gain.",254,mitigating risk ascope pmessii ops 15 minute city mitigating risk ascope pmessii ops 15 minute city leave 15 minute city whenever please city wall restriction zone whatever want call used keep others used lock everyone comment context 15 minute city regeneration project use intelligence framework like ascope pmesii introduces immense potential potential risk framework traditionally employed military intelligence context finding relevance urban planning security government intelligence agency seek understand operational environment gather critical information becomes crucial ass knowledge misused pose serious threat 15 minute city concept imagine intricate web 15 minute city every service infrastructure organization interconnected provide resident accessible sustainable urban living vision undoubtedly transformative open door malevolent actor seeking exploit vulnerability compromise city integrity espionage enemy nation terrorist group unethical entity could easily leverage ascope pmesii identify crucial weak point leading disruption sabotage critical service within city consequence compromise dire extend beyond inconvenience fabric society transportation healthcare utility information network could targeted creating domino effect chaos instability dream harmonious 15 minute city could turn nightmare adequately safeguarded emerging threat preserve integrity vision 15 minute city proactive measure must taken mitigate risk associated ascope pmesii operation comprehensive risk assessment become paramount identifying potential vulnerability unique urban context analysis encompass physical aspect also ever evolving cyber realm protecting critical digital infrastructure utmost importance robust cybersecurity measure must established incorporating advanced encryption intrusion detection system regular security audit digital fortification form front line safeguarding cyberattacks could cripple essential system within city enhanced surveillance intelligence gathering capability indispensable tool detecting deterring suspicious activity utilizing advanced technology video monitoring biometrics data analytics provide invaluable insight potential threat within city collaboration intelligence agency crucial exchanging information ensure real time update vigilance emerging risk public awareness education equally vital creating resilient 15 minute city instilling culture awareness among citizen key stakeholder encourage reporting suspicious activity thus forming collective defense potential threat implementing training program promoting responsible digital practice minimize vulnerability foster united front malicious intent moreover addressing complexity 15 minute city requires multidisciplinary approach government agency private sector entity research institution must join force tackle security challenge collectively information sharing conducting joint exercise leveraging diverse expertise lead development comprehensive security strategy reinforcing city resilience potential threat conclusion realization 15 minute city vision worth pursuing offering promise sustainable livable urban environment however must confront reality potential risk posed ascope pmesii operation embracing proactive multidimensional approach ensure safety longevity 15 minute city concept let u work together preserve vision world economic forum create future accessible efficient urban living flourish resilient adversary seeking exploit vulnerability gain,1.0,4,False,False

It's a strategy that has been used by Fox News, Joe Rogan, Charlie Kirk,  Glenn Beck, and other friends of fossil fuel companies.

SgeQdUXXGPY,2,2023-07-30,FEAR Of The 15 Minute City - Do They Want Us To Live In GHETTOS?,"From reducing carbon footprints and air pollution to stimulating local economies and promoting active lifestyles. We explore how this concept could fundamentally change our urban environments.

Welcome to our in-depth exploration of the 15-minute city concept - a revolutionary idea aimed at transforming the way we live, work, and interact. This innovative concept promises a sustainable, community-oriented, and health-conscious urban future, where everything you need is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.

However, as with any new idea, it's not without its skeptics. Some view it as an attempt by the government to control our movements and force us into ghettos and confined areas, despite the potential advantages it holds for sustainable living, community development, and public health.

In this video, we delve into the benefits of the 15-minute city, from reducing carbon footprints and air pollution to stimulating local economies and promoting active lifestyles. We explore how this concept could fundamentally change our urban environments, drawing on historical precedents and illuminating the essence of city living: community, accessibility, and sustainability.

Yet, we're not just cheerleaders for this concept; we're also sympathetic to the concerns of its critics. We give voice to fears about restricted movement, economic impacts, and the risk of reducing the diversity of experiences cities can offer. We take a balanced look at the 15-minute city, understanding that it's not about coercing people into a certain way of living, but exploring options for a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable urban future.

By the end of the video, we hope to leave you with a nuanced understanding of the 15-minute city concept, with an eye toward its potential benefits and an understanding of its possible drawbacks. It's a complex issue, and we believe it deserves a thorough, balanced examination.

Join us on this journey into the heart of the 15-minute city, where we unravel the truth behind the concept, dispel myths, and address fears head-on. It's a conversation we all need to have, so let's start it together.""

Designing distributed centers at the heart of 15-minute cities
We face a crisis in transportation congestion which is only temporarily relieved by the shift in how people are currently working. The burdens of commuting fall heavily on employees and directly impact employers' bottom line in wages, productivity, and benefits. Activity-based work will continue as the new normal, shifting between the office, home, and the 3rd space as it suits the task at hand. What will follow is an increase in target ratios (CFO's assigning more employees to their workspace) until the pre-pandemic 40% butts in the seats, bubbles to 60%, even 80%+ utilization. Meaning down the road, vibrant inside the office space but tragic bottlenecks getting people to their 2-3 days of office visits.

We'll look at how GHETTOS (ghettos of high-density, often low-income, often minority populations) are being created and forced into cities all over the world.

We'll ask the question: is this really for our benefit? Are the billions of dollars that are being spent on city planning really benefiting us? Or are we being forced into GHETTOS against our will? Check out the video to see what you think!

oVD36OEKh0I,2,2023-08-06,Affordable Walkable Cities: Albany | Troy | Schenectady ‚Äî New York Capital District,"Affordable Walkable Cities: Albany, Troy and Schenectady

We will look at cities that are just plain underrated. We will focus on specific neighborhoods that are walkable and bike-able to services and amenities within a reasonable distance. The 15 minute city in America?
 
What actually qualifies as Affordable? We will be looking at cities with average rent and median home sale price. 

What qualifies as Walkable? The entire city doesn‚Äôt have to be walkable since that‚Äôs unrealistic but they must have at least several neighborhoods with a good walk, bike and transit score. The goal is to find an area within the city where you can absolutely live car free.

This may not be an affordable walkable city but instead an affordable walkable region; 

I am talking about The Capital District of New York that includes the tri city area of Albany, Troy and Schenectady and some folks may throw Saratoga Springs in there as well. 

As much as I enjoy exploring the big cities, it‚Äôs always nice to visit a smaller, walkable city with a more relaxed pace.

Or are they the urban utopia we've all been dreaming of? Is it all just hype, or is there real potential for a brighter urban future? In part 2 of this episode, we share our experiences in 15-minute cities and explore whether they're too good to be true or just misunderstood.

xwH2mQ9DjIc,2,2023-08-06,Mental Illness is a Political identity! 15 minute Cities and Climate Lock Downs!,"#mentalillness #climatechange  #15minutecity 
Roundtable #88

The troubling trend of mental illness becoming a political identity raises concerns about the blurring lines between personal struggles and politics. We explore the impact of modern-day cyborgs on our sense of reality, prompting reflections on our human essence.
The tragic tale of Zhanna Samsonova, a vegan influencer who died of starvation, highlights the dangers of life balance versus narcissism, especially in the era of social media. Climate change is questioned as the sole reason for malaria spread, urging a closer examination of global health factors.
The concept of ""15-minute cities"" and Paris's transformation draw attention to the reshaping of urban living and connectivity. Amidst these realities, the choice between the blue and red pill symbolizes the clash of ideologies shaping our world.
The episode also addresses intriguing developments around Trudeau and his impact on Canadian politics. In addition, we encounter the portrayal of transgender representation in a Coca-Cola ad, reflecting evolving societal trends. The heartbreaking case of a mother's arrest after her toddler's sexual abuse underscores the urgency of addressing darker aspects of human behavior.

Over 2,700 structures were destroyed in Lahaina, Maui, valued at approximately $5.6 billion.
Meanwhile, President Joe Biden, with $115 billion sent to Ukraine, offers just $1.9 million ($700 per household) to Lahaina.
This is profoundly disrespectful.

This Maui dog looks petrified!  A high-temperature pyroclastic flow hit the city at high speed and filled all the spots not yet engulfed by other volcanic materials, so that anybody still in the city died at once of thermal shock. The bodies of these victims remained in the same position as when the pyroclastic flow hit them and, being covered by calcified layers of ash, the form of their bodies was preserved even after the biological material decomposed.
SOZT
The fires in Maui, as we explained, were caused by sudden plate subduction because Hawaii lies on a spot in the Pacific where 3 of the 4 Pacific Plate subsections touch. At a time when the Nibiru cover-up is still going strong, the common man is told anything but the truth. The ground was hot enough to burn tires and the seats of cars, but the treetops were left intact. Such fires also occurred in California and Greece http://www.zetatalk.com/newsletr/issue634.htm with the same signature. http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/31jy2018.htm0
A petrified dog amid the burned out cars on Maui died suddenly from heat shock and became a statue as did the bodies of Pompeii by glassification of ash on its body.

In order to get back my advanced features I must either complete my TFA or record a short video of myself to prove who I am and that this is in fact my YT channel. Folks, that is extortion and I will not comply.

0HQsOYCiEeA,2,2023-08-20,12-Year-Old Mocks Greta Thunberg On Mass Surveillance & Smart Cities,"This past Saturday, the Stop Oxford: No 15 Minute Cities community day of action was held in Oxford in the UK, attracting thousands of protesters. Among the speakers was a 12-year-old girl named ‚ÄúJasmin‚Äù who quickly went viral for claiming the 15-minute neighbourhoods were ‚Äúsoon to become digital ID facial recognition zones‚Äù.

Guest host Craig ‚ÄúPasta‚Äù Jardula, along with Jimmy Dore and Americans‚Äô Comedian Kurt Metzger discuss the newfound prominence of this so-called anti-Greta Thunberg.

Obs9Xh875Lg,2,2023-08-20,15-Minute City: Urban Planning Solution To Climate Change | CNA Correspondent,"Since the passing of the historic Paris Agreement in 2015, governments are pledging their commitment to net zero carbon emissions. Major cities around the world are also exploring innovative ways to reduce their carbon footprint. From green energy to sustainable farming and tourism, several cities are embracing a new urban planning concept ‚Äì the 15-minute city. The idea is that everything we need ‚Äì workplaces, shops, parks, schools ‚Äì should be within a 15-minute walk or cycle. 

Spearheading this concept is the French capital of Paris. Its mayor Anne Hidalgo has championed it since early 2020, and has embedded it into a broader plan to promote active mobility at the expense of cars. Many cities have touted it as a climate solution and have achieved considerable success; cities including Houston, Milan, Brussels, Valencia, Chengdu and Melbourne, as well as Paris where it is best known. 

00:15 What is the 15-Minute City concept?
03:38 Redesigning Paris to combat global warming
08:42 Roads converted in Bristol in community spaces
11:33 Encouraging drivers to give up their cars
16:31 Singapore's urban design to reduce travel times
20:54 New solutions for a post-pandemic society

But despite the changes in opinion at the centre of government, local authorities are still rolling out schemes to improve local communities. They have been drawing inspiration from the popular urban planning concept of ""The 15-minute city"", where you have everything you need within 15 minutes of your front door.

In this gripping episode, a labyrinth of enigmatic themes is explored, unraveling a web of intrigue. The journey commences with a tantalizing glance into the world of Carbon Tax as a purported solution. As the curtain lifts, the shadowy landscape of ""15-minute cities"" is unveiled, beckoning us to question their true purpose. Veering further into the depths, the concept of a ""Walk Score"" introduces an element of surveillance within the urban fabric.

Yet, the puzzle takes a darker turn as the enigma of owning nothing for happiness is dissected, raising suspicions of orchestrated control. Amidst the whispers, a chilling revelation surfaces: is human intelligence truly ascending or is a veiled force manipulating perceptions? The ethereal allure of ""15-minute cities"" is juxtaposed with unsettling questions: who are the architects, and what clandestine motives fuel this construct?

Within this enigmatic theater, the entanglement of Fitbit and alleged China spying tales beckons, unveiling the cloak-and-dagger nature of modern surveillance. As the narrative unfolds, the inquiry deepens into the psyche of the modern narcissist, echoing with the resonance of obscured agendas.

The exploration veers toward the arcane as the World Economic Forum's assertion on suburbs and health is contemplated, casting a shadow of doubt on the intentions behind their claims. In the midst of this tapestry, the concept of dissentive emerges‚Äîa manipulative orchestration of behavior.

Venturing further, the unsettling revelation emerges that ""15-minute cities"" may already be surreptitiously at play, concealing hidden designs. A figure emerges from the shadows, Josh Green, offering glimpses of a 15-minute city near Lahaina‚Äîbegging us to contemplate the unseen orchestrations.

As the puzzle pieces align, the enigma deepens with Andre Cadorette's revelations on the Great Reset, echoing with whispers of a covert agenda. The mystique of personal transformation beckons, hinting at the undercurrents of empowerment in uncertain times. In the same breath, Christina Anderson's insights cast a spotlight on the intersection of ""15-minute cities"" and Climate Change lockdowns, evoking a sense of controlled destiny.

The climax emerges as a disconcerting dialogue explores the potential diabolic programming of the young, ushering the audience into a realm of disquieting possibilities. In this clandestine theater, the threads of perceived truth unravel, revealing an intricate tapestry of orchestrated narratives that leaves the audience pondering, questioning, and delving into the abyss of the unknown.

The concept of 15-minute cities, aiming for accessible amenities within a short walk, has gained traction. In Korea, Chrono-Urbanism supports walkable neighborhood planning where essential services align with residents' living spaces. By evaluating walkability, bike accessibility, and transit, this study develops a FOSS4G-based tool for urban amenity distribution.

The tool integrates multiple accessibility aspects to determine optimal urban amenity locations, using a network-based approach to minimize travel costs. It's designed using QGIS and Python, considering resident population, existing amenities, and urban environment. The tool's application assists officials, planners, and researchers in 15-minute city projects, identifying amenity needs, enhancing walkability, and aiding sustainable urban development.

By leveraging FOSS4G, this tool promotes data-driven amenity placement, encourages sustainable transportation, and contributes to equitable urban development. It aligns with the 15-minute city vision, enhancing citizens' quality of life and fostering transparency and collaboration between planners and the public.",31,2023 developing foss4g walkable living area planning aid korean 15 minute city junyoung choi foss4g 2023 prizren concept 15 minute city aiming accessible amenity within short walk ha gained traction korea chrono urbanism support walkable neighborhood planning essential service align resident living space evaluating walkability bike accessibility transit study develops foss4g based tool urban amenity distribution tool integrates multiple accessibility aspect determine optimal urban amenity location using network based approach minimize travel cost designed using qgis python considering resident population existing amenity urban environment tool application assist official planner researcher 15 minute city project identifying amenity need enhancing walkability aiding sustainable urban development leveraging foss4g tool promotes data driven amenity placement encourages sustainable transportation contributes equitable urban development aligns 15 minute city vision enhancing citizen quality life fostering transparency collaboration planner public,0.0,0,False,

Prepare to have your perceptions challenged and your imagination ignited as we dive into the controversial notion surrounding Maui wildfires and their potential link to an urban transformation agenda.

The fake Maui wildfires were orchestrated by the globalist elite to poison our air, water, and soil, and redistribute property into the hands of the elite, according to a World Economic Forum insider who warns that ‚ÄúBuild back better‚Äù literally means destroying things first and then rebuilding according to New World Order plans.

The World Economic Forum is using Maui as Ground Zero to launch a devastating attack on the people, which has laid the groundwork for the rapid reconstruction of the island into 15 minute cities designed to lock down ordinary people in vast outdoor prisons from which there will be no escape.

qz1hRDvaicY,2,2023-08-27,"Affordable Walkable Cities: Cincinnati, Ohio","We will look at cities that are just plain underrated. We will focus on specific neighborhoods that are walkable and bike-able to services and amenities within a reasonable distance. The 15 minute city in America?
 
What actually qualifies as Affordable? We will be looking at cities with average rent and median home sale price. 

What qualifies as Walkable? The entire city doesn‚Äôt have to be walkable since that‚Äôs unrealistic but they must have at least several neighborhoods with a good walk, bike and transit score. The goal is to find an area within the city where you can absolutely live car free.

Cincy is extremely hilly which creates a lot of fascinating neighborhoods that adjust to the terrain.
You got that Down-home hospitality, common to many Midwestern cities

A little bit of that Small town feel with Big-city amenities, such as universities, the second oldest opera house in the US and professional sports teams. 

People are migrating to Cincinnati thanks to the presence of the Big 3: P&G, Kroger, and GE.  

Cincy has a modest bus system and a free streetcar that travels a 3.6-mile loop connecting 
major employment centers, arts, entertainment and businesses.

I waffled on featuring Cincinnati because I‚Äôve personally never been there and wasn‚Äôt sold that it had truly walkable areas but after talking with a few folks from Cincy and researching the city heavily

It blew away my expectations and even had what i feel could be the best neighborhood in all of the midwest, Over the Rhine

This is the 2nd city in Ohio that I‚Äôve featured but I have a third city on my list, which one is it?

The cities of the future are poised to be drastically different from the ones we know today. In this video, we explore four key trends that are shaping the urban landscape of tomorrow.

The first trend is green planning of public spaces. With growing populations and limited resources, cities are facing increasing pressure to become more sustainable. One solution is to increase green spaces, which can help cool urban areas, reduce air pollution, and improve the natural resilience of the environment. Singapore is currently leading the way in this area, but even less wealthy cities like Freetown in Sierra Leone are making strides by planting one million trees in three years.

The second trend is the development of a smart healthcare system. Cities have a responsibility to create a healthy environment, and digital technologies are helping to make that possible. With personalized healthcare, individualized care plans can be created for each citizen that rely on data and analytics to help them make the right health and behavioral choices. Chicago is an example of a city that is prioritizing the creation of an interconnected health and wellness ecosystem.

The third trend is designing cities so that amenities and most services are within a 15-minute walk or bike ride of any resident. This ""15-minute"" city concept reduces carbon emissions and is a decentralized urban planning model where each local area contains all the basic social functions for living and working. Paris is implementing the La ville du quart d'heure program, which aims to reduce carbon emissions, prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, and decentralize the city.

Finally, the fourth trend of the cities of the future is mobility: smart, sustainable, and as-a-service. Multimodal mobility on demand and Mobility-as-a-Service platforms are becoming popular, allowing residents to digitally plan and book door-to-door trips, access automated last-mile delivery services with seamless payment models, and use the same fare card for all modes of transportation. Los Angeles is working to implement sustainable and smart mobility solutions.

These four trends are shaping the cities of the future, and it's up to urban planners, policymakers, and citizens to help bring them to life.",7853,live 2050 city new era pro robot business inquiry info prorobots gmail com instagram pro robot issue talk city future city future expert talk 5 6g technology internet thing drone total digitalization enough see top trend shaping happy human life example implementation well bonus real city future japan watch video end write comment see city future 0 00 intro 0 28 artificial intelligence 2 00 smart health care 3 10 city 15 minute 4 30 intelligent mobility service 5 56 innovative ecosystem 7 05 smart building 8 35 green city 10 11 cyber security 11 26 police surveillance forecasting 12 28 city future japan prorobots robot robot futuretechnologies robotics pro robot channel robot future technology interested science technology new technology robotics manifestation science news technology news today science technology news 2022 future possible expand future release topic today vlog talk complex thing follows tech news make review exhibition conference event main character best robot world subscribe channel like video join u instagram telegram facebook music inaudio inaudio mokkamusic soft light city future poised drastically different one know today video explore four key trend shaping urban landscape tomorrow first trend green planning public space growing population limited resource city facing increasing pressure become sustainable one solution increase green space help cool urban area reduce air pollution improve natural resilience environment singapore currently leading way area even le wealthy city like freetown sierra leone making stride planting one million tree three year second trend development smart healthcare system city responsibility create healthy environment digital technology helping make possible personalized healthcare individualized care plan created citizen rely data analytics help make right health behavioral choice chicago example city prioritizing creation interconnected health wellness ecosystem third trend designing city amenity service within 15 minute walk bike ride resident 15 minute city concept reduces carbon emission decentralized urban planning model local area contains basic social function living working paris implementing la ville du quart heure program aim reduce carbon emission prioritize pedestrian cyclist decentralize city finally fourth trend city future mobility smart sustainable service multimodal mobility demand mobility service platform becoming popular allowing resident digitally plan book door door trip access automated last mile delivery service seamless payment model use fare card mode transportation los angeles working implement sustainable smart mobility solution four trend shaping city future urban planner policymakers citizen help bring life,372.0,49,False,

There were 2 fires started in Spokane County on the 18th of August 2023.  One I will discuss in future videos and the other known as the Oregon Rd fire which I will discuss in this video as it affected me personally. In my first video about this fire I discussed a little about a possible plan to burn people out of rural areas forcing them into 15 minute smart cities.  Spokane was picked back in 2015 and sponsored by ""Envision America"" to be a smart city.  I'll discuss that in this video a little but also I show how the state concentrated on it's saving it's own profit margin rather than people's homes. Let me know your thoughts with a comment.

NqHUxsYHvNI,2,2023-08-27,Is Telosa The Future Of American Cities?,"Would you live in this city? 

Telosa is a proposed utopian planned city in the United States, conceived by American billionaire Marc Lore and announced in September 2021. The project has a target population of 5 million people by 2050, with the first phase of construction expected to house 50,000. The location had initially not been chosen, with the project's planners intending for the city to be built on cheap land in Appalachia or the American West desert. However, in a town hall in February 2023, the project's leaders narrowed its future location down to Nevada, Utah, or Arizona.

#Travel #Future #Adventure #Tourism #Wanderlust

The name Telosa is derived from the Ancient Greek word telos, in this case meaning ""purpose"". The city is designed to be a model of sustainability and social equity, with a focus on renewable energy, walkability, and mixed-income housing. It is also intended to be a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.

Some of the key features of Telosa include:

A 15-minute city design, with all essential services within a 15-minute walk or bike ride of every home.

A focus on renewable energy, with the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.

A commitment to social equity, with a mix of housing prices and a focus on creating opportunities for all residents.

A focus on innovation and entrepreneurship, with the goal of becoming a hub for new businesses and technologies.

The development of Telosa is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to be a major milestone in the development of sustainable and equitable cities.

Here are some additional details about the city's design:

The city will be divided into 100 districts, each with its own unique character.

The streets will be designed to be pedestrian-friendly, with wide sidewalks and plenty of trees.
The city will have a network of public transportation, including buses, trains, and autonomous vehicles.

The city will have a green belt that will surround it and provide a buffer between the city and the surrounding desert.

The city will have a number of parks and open spaces, including a central park that will be the size of Central Park in New York City.

The development of Telosa is a massive undertaking, but it is a project that has the potential to change the world. If successful, Telosa could become a model for sustainable and equitable cities around the world.",519,telosa future american city would live city telosa proposed utopian planned city united state conceived american billionaire marc lore announced september 2021 project ha target population 5 million people 2050 first phase construction expected house 50 000 location initially chosen project planner intending city built cheap land appalachia american west desert however town hall february 2023 project leader narrowed future location nevada utah arizona travel future adventure tourism wanderlust name telosa derived ancient greek word telos case meaning purpose city designed model sustainability social equity focus renewable energy walkability mixed income housing also intended hub innovation entrepreneurship key feature telosa include 15 minute city design essential service within 15 minute walk bike ride every home focus renewable energy goal carbon neutral 2050 commitment social equity mix housing price focus creating opportunity resident focus innovation entrepreneurship goal becoming hub new business technology development telosa still early stage ha potential major milestone development sustainable equitable city additional detail city design city divided 100 district unique character street designed pedestrian friendly wide sidewalk plenty tree city network public transportation including bus train autonomous vehicle city green belt surround provide buffer city surrounding desert city number park open space including central park size central park new york city development telosa massive undertaking project ha potential change world successful telosa could become model sustainable equitable city around world,19.0,1,False,

aUuYoTE2ko8,2,2023-08-27,Lahaina: the first US Fifteen Minute Smart City?,"Lahaina: the first US Fifteen Minute Smart City?

Hello.  Betty Krawczyk here.  Why do I think that Lahaina, Maui is now, after the monstrous fires that have wiped out most of the city and so many of it‚Äôs people, that there is really no other, at least in my mind, of any possible explanation, other that a governmental seizure of the  indigenous lands of the city. 

On August 8 no sirens or alarms of any kind were sounded in Lahaina to warn the people that an unheard of kind of hellish fire storm was quickly convulsing the city with vicious weird  flames that melted the metals of houses, cars, commercial buildings, and the flesh of human beings.  Have you heard the cries of the indigenous people and others sounding around the world thorough the internet of ‚ÄúWhere are the missing children?‚Äù

Some on the islanders say that over two thousand of missing children  have not enrolled or  re-enrolled for school.  But if the children can‚Äôt be accounted for then what  has happened to them? Were thy incinerated along with their parents when the police stopped families from driving to the main roads that would lead out of the town to safety?  The police chief who has since resigned ( John Pelletie) said  that he ordered his men to block the roads leading away from the fire because he was afraid that if the drivers ran over a downed power line it might cause deaths. His reasoning had to be one of...better to let them all burn to cinders at once.  And they did.  The fires were so hot there wasn‚Äôt any skeletons left in or lying about the cars and trucks.  But why?  The police chief coudn‚Äôt have been so dim witted  to have believed this stupid, lying treacherous story.  And the water story doesn‚Äôt add up either.

When many of the people tried at first to fight the fire with their water hoses they found there was no water.  The water had been turned off.  Why?  The person in charge of the water gave another damnable excuse...the water was too sacred to be used in such an inequitable way without many permissions.  If none of these facts being flashed around the world moves you to believe that Lahaina, Maui was deliberately destroyed and it‚Äôs survivors  largely lost in grief and uncertainty, that all this destruction and loss of life  in order to build the first US fifteen minute city, then I will  provide more next time.

https://www.spreaker.com/user/euvc/utvc-daniel-master-v1

Today we are happy to welcome Daniel Hanemann, CEO and Founder at wundertax, the tech startup he co-founded in 2016 and returned to as CEO in 2022. Daniel is a growth-oriented entrepreneur who has founded and built high-growth companies in six countries. He has ten years of international experience scaling businesses with a focus on technology, marketing, finance and venture capital. Daniel is passionate about sustainability, fitness and problem solving, be it relocation or access to government services. Outside of work, Daniel is a comedian best known for his stand-up and improv performances. He believes comedy is the best sideline to a CEO's more serious job of helping taxpayers maximize their tax returns while minimizing tax return time.

In this episode you‚Äôll learn:

How convenient. Everything you could possibly want within just 15 minutes of of walking.

Fantastic. Utopia.

But how soon will it move from convenient to ""you're not authorised to leave"", ""Show us your papers""?

How quickly will it shift to total lockdown, total control of the people by the ruling classes?

Total dystopia.
Makes you think.

3 Council Members Willing to Enter Into Dialogue to Understand ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Happening at the Municipal Level of This Country‚Äôs Government?‚Äù

A Brief History of the KICLEI Solution - from the KICLEI Primer - https://kiclei.substack.com/p/introducing-kiclei

On June 26, 2023, local lawyer John Dunn was determined to address Peterborough's Declaration of Climate Emergency, so he and Maggie Braun gave deputations to Peterborough City Council. John Dunn addressed climate science, and Maggie Braun discussed the implementation of Agenda 21 through Canadian Municipalities. The video of this deputation went viral, and several others followed, including Joel and Margaret Sussman of Auroras' deputation.

On August 1, 2023, Maggie addressed the Douro Dummer Council regarding the U.N.-driven Official Plan for Peterborough County. This plan would be ""a death sentence to their township."" Sixty-five locals attended to support the delegation's recommendation.

Following the Deputation, the councillors of Douro Dummer agreed that they ""could not in good faith approve Peterborough Counties Official Plan"" and that the delegation ""stated facts"" and ""it was time they stand and be counted."" The Council voted to delay the approval of the official plan and seek more public consultation.

The following day, the mayors and councillors of Peterborough County met to discuss the approval of the official plan; this led to a robust and empowering discussion with many of the County's Mayors in agreement. The official plan was sent back to the province and will require approval from another round of public consultation and local councils before being adopted.
In conclusion, the KICLEI Solution was instrumental in bringing together like-minded individuals to address the pressing issue of climate change. The confidence and determination of John Dunn, Maggie Braun, and other community members led to a positive outcome that not only benefited their township but also set a precedent for other communities to follow. Their actions have shown that small and large town councils can make a significant impact when they stand up and be counted.

R√©imaginer le transport urbain : les couloirs verts comme catalyseurs pour mat√©rialiser une ville  de 15 minutes √† Bogota, Juan Pablo CAICEDO

Pr√©sentation

En 2020, l'administration de Claudia L√≥pez a lanc√© un projet d'infrastructure urbaine sans pr√©c√©dent : le couloir vert de la Carrera S√©ptima. Cette initiative donne la priorit√© √† la mobilit√© durable, en allouant plus de la moiti√© de l'espace routier √† des zones favorables aux pi√©tons, √† des pistes cyclables et √† des transports publics efficaces, au b√©n√©fice des citoyens vuln√©rables. L'objectif √† long terme est d'institutionnaliser cette approche et d'en faire un mod√®le reproductible √† l'√©chelle mondiale. Inspir√©s par la ¬´ ville en 15 minutes ¬ª de Paris, les couloirs verts peuvent faciliter la mobilit√© durable et la renaturalisation des espaces publics lorsque la volont√© politique est au rendez-vous. Ce projet de recherche est l'occasion d'approfondir la recherche et de fa√ßonner ce projet transformateur avec la collaboration de sp√©cialistes des sciences comportementales, cognitives et sociales, afin d'√©clairer les politiques d'am√©nagement urbain dans le monde entier.

Juan Pablo Caicedo est actuellement chef de projet pour le projet de couloir vert de la ville de Bogota. Il est √©galement professeur adjoint de gestion des affaires publiques au d√©partement de sciences politiques et de relations internationales de la Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, √† Bogota. Il est titulaire d'un master en administration publique et d'un master en urbanisme de l'universit√© de Harvard. Il est avocat et titulaire d'une licence en litt√©rature de l'universit√© de Los Andes, ainsi que d'√©tudes sup√©rieures en gestion publique et en institutions administratives de la m√™me universit√©. Il a notamment conseill√© des autorit√©s publiques √† Mexico, Chicago, New York, Boston et Bogota. Son travail se concentre sur la recherche de solutions et d'approches innovantes en mati√®re de politique urbaine, de mobilit√© durable et de d√©veloppement ax√© sur les transports. Il a √©galement √©t√© chef de cabinet du ministre de la gouvernance sous l'administration Santos.

Reimagining Urban Transportation: Green Corridors as Catalysts for Materializing a 15-minute City in Bogot√°, Juan Pablo CAICEDO

Presentation 

In 2020, Claudia L√≥pez's administration introduced an unprecedented urban infrastructure project - the Green Corridor on Carrera S√©ptima. This initiative prioritizes sustainable mobility, allocating
over half of the road space to pedestrian-friendly areas, cycling lanes, and efficient public transportation, benefiting vulnerable citizens. The long-term vision is to institutionalize the approach, becoming a replicable model globally. Inspired by Paris' ‚Äú15-minute city,‚Äù green corridors can facilitate sustainable mobility and re-naturalization of public spaces where political will aligns. This research project is an opportunity to deepen research and shape this transformative project with collaboration from behavioral, cognitive, and social scientists, informing urban planning policies worldwide.

Juan Pablo Caicedo currently serves as Project Manager for the Green Corridor Project for the City of Bogot√°. He is also adjunct lecturer of Governance in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, in Bogot√°. He holds a Master in Public Administration and a Master Urban Planning from Harvard University. Lawyer and Bachelor degree in literature from the University of Los Andes with post-graduate studies in Public Management and Administrative Institutions from the same University. His track record includes consulting for public authorities in Mexico City, Chicago, New York, Boston and Bogota. His work focuses on finding innovative solutions and approaches to urban policy, sustainable mobility, transportation-oriented development. He also served as Chief of Staff for the Governance Minister during the Santos Administration.",101,juan pablo caicedo paris ia idea reimagining urban transportation conf rence dans le cadre du cycle paris ia idea ce pr sentations courtes marquent le de r sidences criture un mois au cours desquelles chercheurs invit r digeront un article pr sentant la version finitive une id e ou un concept sur lequel il travaillent depuis de ann e ce courtes pr sentations en ligne de 20 minute sont suivies de discussion avec le public r imaginer le transport urbain le couloirs verts comme catalyseurs pour mat rialiser une ville de 15 minute bogota juan pablo caicedo pr sentation en 2020 l administration de claudia l pez lanc un projet infrastructure urbaine sans pr c dent le couloir vert de la carrera ptima cette initiative donne la priorit la mobilit durable en allouant plus de la moiti de l espace routier de zone favorables aux pi ton de piste cyclables et de transport public efficaces au b n fice de citoyens vuln rables l objectif long terme est institutionnaliser cette approche et en faire un mod le reproductible l chelle mondiale inspir par la ville en 15 minute de paris le couloirs verts peuvent faciliter la mobilit durable et la renaturalisation de espaces public lorsque la volont politique est au rendez vous ce projet de recherche est l occasion approfondir la recherche et de fa onner ce projet transformateur avec la collaboration de sp cialistes de science comportementales cognitives et sociales afin clairer le politiques nagement urbain dans le monde entier juan pablo caicedo est actuellement chef de projet pour le projet de couloir vert de la ville de bogota il est galement professeur adjoint de gestion de affaire publiques au partement de science politiques et de relation internationale de la pontificia universidad javeriana bogota il est titulaire un master en administration publique et un master en urbanisme de l universit de harvard il est avocat et titulaire une licence en litt rature de l universit de los andes ainsi que tudes sup rieures en gestion publique et en institution administratives de la universit il notamment conseill de autorit publiques mexico chicago new york boston et bogota son travail se concentre sur la recherche de solution et approches innovantes en mati de politique urbaine de mobilit durable et de veloppement ax sur le transport il galement chef de cabinet du ministre de la gouvernance sou l administration santos reimagining urban transportation green corridor catalyst materializing 15 minute city bogot juan pablo caicedo presentation 2020 claudia l pez administration introduced unprecedented urban infrastructure project green corridor carrera ptima initiative prioritizes sustainable mobility allocating half road space pedestrian friendly area cycling lane efficient public transportation benefiting vulnerable citizen long term vision institutionalize approach becoming replicable model globally inspired paris 15 minute city green corridor facilitate sustainable mobility naturalization public space political aligns research project opportunity deepen research shape transformative project collaboration behavioral cognitive social scientist informing urban planning policy worldwide juan pablo caicedo currently serf project manager green corridor project city bogot also adjunct lecturer governance department political science international relation pontificia universidad javeriana bogot hold master public administration master urban planning harvard university lawyer bachelor degree literature university los andes post graduate study public management administrative institution university track record includes consulting public authority mexico city chicago new york boston bogota work focus finding innovative solution approach urban policy sustainable mobility transportation oriented development also served chief staff governance minister santos administration,1.0,0,False,

Cambridge, a city nestled in the heart of England, is a place where tradition, innovation, and intellectual pursuit converge. Home to one of the world's most prestigious universities, the University of Cambridge, it's a city steeped in history and academic excellence.

At the heart of Cambridge lies the historic Cambridge University, founded in the 13th century. The university's exquisite architecture, including the iconic King's College Chapel, is a testament to centuries of learning and scholarship. A punt ride along the serene River Cam, surrounded by lush greenery and historic colleges, is a quintessential Cambridge experience.

The city's vibrant cultural scene extends beyond academia. The Fitzwilliam Museum houses a remarkable collection of art and antiquities, while the ADC Theatre and Corn Exchange offer a diverse range of performances.

Cambridge's commitment to innovation and technology is evident in the Silicon Fen, a hub for startups and tech companies.

‚¨á About Mark McClinchie ‚¨á About Mark McClinchie ‚¨á

I am a real estate agent in #Pittsburgh. Fun fact: In the Spring of 2022 I appeared on HGTV's House Hunters episode, Price or Project in Pittsburgh, which featured my out of town clients that found me on YouTube.  You can stream S210 E13 to check it out!

Helping individuals and families that are not familiar with the Pittsburgh region navigate a long distance home buying process requires a unique set of skills that I have honed over the past few years. 

While much of my business is in Allegheny County (the largest and most central county in the Pittsburgh region), I also have done extensive work in the four surrounding counties of Beaver, Butler, Washington, and Westmoreland. As a former public school administrator in the area, I can offer detailed information about school districts throughout the region. I work with all types of budgets (low to high) and all types of buyers (first-time, FHA, cash, retired, investors, up-sizers, veterans, etc).

Out of town home buyers are often nervous and stressed about the entire process not knowing much about the local housing market, the communities, or even the connections for service providers such as lenders, home inspectors, insurance agents, and contractors. I take the lead on every step of the transaction from start to finish to provide my clients with clear and accurate information, put them in touch with the right people, and ultimately guide them to make the transition to Pittsburgh as seamless as possible.

I grew up in the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh (graduated from North Allegheny), and now live in Mt Lebanon with my amazing wife and four children (three in college and one still in Mt. Lebanon schools).  I love travelling (especially to Disney), great food/drink (coffee snob), and love playing/watching sports (PNC Park is the BEST ballpark in America).

It is never too early (or too late) to contact me. In fact, the home buying season is on üî• and so is my schedule. But I always make time for new clients. Contact me today so we can set up a virtual consultation to learn more about your needs and timeline.

iYWUHyf6yCE,2,2023-10-01,Tory minister claims councils want to decide ‚Äòhow often you can go to shops‚Äô,"Transport secretary Mark Harper managed to get through his conference speech without a single mention of HS2.

Mr Harper instead talked up the supposed ‚Äúwar on motorists‚Äù and said the Tories will stop the ‚Äúmisuse of 15-minute cities‚Äù ‚Äì before claiming that local authorities wanted to regulate how often people could drive to the shops.

The cabinet minister said ‚Äúwhat is sinister is the idea of local councils deciding how often you can go to the shops‚Äù. 

Councils do not decide how often people can go to shops. He also said it was sinister for councils to ""ration who uses roads"" and how they ""police it all with CCTV"".

H5lb4BLLA0Y,2,2023-10-01,New UK Driving Laws to Tackle Controversial 15 Minute Cities and 20mph Speed Limit,"Visit https://www.qlmbusinessnews.com/home for more news stories
üöó UK Government to Crack Down on 15-Minute Cities and 20mph Speed Limits üõ£Ô∏è

In a major announcement at the Conservative Party Conference, Transport Secretary Mark Harper unveiled a comprehensive plan to protect drivers from controversial motoring schemes. Harper criticized the misuse of ""15-minute cities,"" which aim to place essential amenities within a short walk or cycle ride, arguing that some councils were overzealously restricting driving options. He also took issue with blanket 20mph speed limits, suggesting they often punish drivers unnecessarily.

Key Highlights:
- The government plans to investigate ways to restrict overzealous traffic management measures, including potential penalties for non-compliant councils.
- Guidance will be updated to ensure councils consider local residents' input before implementing traffic schemes.
- 30mph will remain the default speed limit for urban roads, with 20mph zones reserved for areas with a clear need.
- A centralized app for parking payments will make it more convenient for motorists.
- Utility companies will face extra charges if their street works exceed the expected timeframe, with the proceeds going toward road maintenance.

Join the discussion on these proposed changes and share your thoughts in the comments below. Don't forget to subscribe for more updates on UK transport policies and road safety. üö¶

Dr. Nathaniel ‚ÄúDinky‚Äù Von Einsiedel, an urban development and management specialist, speaks about the ‚Äú15-minute city‚Äù where residents may get to where they need to go in 15-minutes through transportation or simply by walking to their destinations. He said one of the biggest challenges in transportation development is the fragmented laws on land ownership, which needs government intervention.

Q3d9qRw4Hp8,2,2023-10-08,fifteen minute cities | 15 min cities | sustainable development | city planning #upsc #shorts,"‚Äò15-minute city‚Äô concept. It was first presented by Franco-Colombian scientist Carlos Moreno and envisions a more decentralised city.

The city is not divided into shopping, residential or business districts, but into networks of self-sufficient neighbourhoods wherein individuals can feel connected and catered for. The concept propagates access to goods and services, smaller-scale offices, retail and hospitality, co-working and open green spaces.

The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, was one of the first to embrace this concept that represented a world wherein residents could meet their daily needs on foot within a 15-minute radius of their homes. 

The concept of a 15-minute city is being hailed as a spatial development model to help foster a more local, healthy, equitable and sustainable way of life. The spatial manifestation of this concept could override the need to travel and convert long-distance trips through motorised modes with definite environmental impacts into shorter trips.

The discussion around the concept has gained momentum during the COVID-19 crisis, when the need for ‚Äòpersonal travel space‚Äô has become premium, and walking and cycling have emerged as vital forms of mobility for safe and efficient travel.

There are several examples of cities around the globe that have been responding to this opportunity to expand cycling and pedestrian infrastructure in the wake of the ongoing pandemic. Many have created temporary bike lanes (Bogot√° and Berlin), opened streets for pedestrians and bicyclists (Seattle and San Francisco), plans for road-space reallocation (Milan and Barcelona), launched public and private shared bike schemes (Lisbon and Mexico City), etc.

The same is being emulated in several Indian cities and such efforts should be upscaled further.

The concept also humanises the city scale and gives an opportunity to create public spaces in neighbourhoods ‚Äî sidewalks, parks, squares, traditional markets, and small plazas, etc. It allows for application of other urban design concepts such as ‚Äòeyes-on-street‚Äô, ‚Äòbuild-to-edge‚Äô conditions, etc. to enhance their liveability and human happiness.

Considering time poverty in the present urban way of life, the same would also enable investment of time saved in travelling in more productive activities.

Sustainable communities allow people of all walks of life, especially the poor, disabled and elderly affordable housing and access to all amenities.

his presentation delved into the concept of the 15-minute city, introduced by Carlos Morenos in2021, which embraces human-centeredurbanism principles to address urbanchallenges through inclusive interventionsprioritizing liveability and accessibility. Theidea envisions neighbourhoods as central todaily life, aiming for a balance in services,leisure, work, and social interactions throughwalkability. The presentation highlightedthe absence of a universal solution to urbanissues, emphasizing the importance ofcontext-specific understanding. Variousconcepts, including 15-minute cities, wereexplored as tools for creating liveableneighbourhoods through interventions like service de-concentration, design, natural-basedsolutions, and human-centered density. The discussion then shifted to the applicationof the 15-minute city concept in Tirana, considering its rapid development, increasedtraffic, congestion, and emerging mobility challenges. Key infrastructure interventionsin Tirana were highlighted, and the presentation argued for addressing transportationchallenges by focusing on inner mobility and cultivating a new walking culture. However,it acknowledged recent interventions favouring automobile transport, hindering thedevelopment of intercity walkable connections. The presentation concluded by urgingurban planners, experts, educators, and citizens to critically examine existing plans andexplore innovative approaches to effectively address Tirana‚Äôs evolving urban landscape.",58,amanda terpo 15 minute city dr amanda terpo sustainable mobility expert researcher independent consultant topic 15 minute city promising alternative urban development presentation delved concept 15 minute city introduced carlos morenos 2021 embrace human centered urbanism principle address urban challenge inclusive intervention prioritizing liveability accessibility idea envisions neighbourhood central daily life aiming balance service leisure work social interaction walkability presentation highlighted absence universal solution urban issue emphasizing importance context specific understanding various concept including 15 minute city explored tool creating liveable neighbourhood intervention like service de concentration design natural based solution human centered density discussion shifted application 15 minute city concept tirana considering rapid development increased traffic congestion emerging mobility challenge key infrastructure intervention tirana highlighted presentation argued addressing transportation challenge focusing inner mobility cultivating new walking culture however acknowledged recent intervention favouring automobile transport hindering development intercity walkable connection presentation concluded urging urban planner expert educator citizen critically examine existing plan explore innovative approach effectively address tirana evolving urban landscape,0.0,0,False,

Witness the anticipation of change as the script unfolds the imminent Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) around crucial transit hubs, particularly the bustling SkyTrain stations.

The vision painted involves a future where Vancouver embraces TOD, fostering efficient public transportation, mixed-use neighborhoods, and economic vibrancy. Amid the optimism, the script doesn't shy away from acknowledging potential downsides, including gentrification and social impacts.

g_5gsN3B7Do,3,2023-11-12,"15 Minute Cities, 50 in 5, & Wound Care with Lisa","Have you heard about the UN, Bill Gates, and The Rockefeller Foundation launching the '50-in-5' agenda to make digital IDs, vaccine passports, and CBDCs mandatory to participate in society by 2030? What about the concept of 15-minute cities where everything you need will be available by walking, bike, or public transportation? 

These are just two examples of how life will change soon. While these people like to use words like inclusivity, sustainability, and equality, they deliberately forget about surveillance, tracking, and control.  

Lisa and I will go over what this means in the very near future and how this all ties into The World Economic Forum agenda. This started as a ""Tin Foil Hat Time"" subject, but I'm unsure how far-fetched it is. These days, Conspiracy theories are just spoiler alerts, and these seem to be the same type of Conspiracy ""Theory."" 

Lisa will also be going over wound care and any questions she gets towards the end of the show. She will also be back in a couple of weeks to go into more detail about SHTF medical issues.

We begin by describing our local community, which right where we live, is more like a 5 minute city. Almost everything we need is usually within 1 mile of us. We extend our 15 minute city discussion by looking more into how these communities would apply really well to rural areas. The 15 minute city concept would be awesome in places where big companies are moving to more rural areas and people would want to live closer to where they work. In our home state of Arizona, these opportunities might be closer than you think because of the semiconductor industry. I give a personal example of another kind of manufacturing company that moved to one of these rural communities and should become a 15 minute city. We finish by talking more on local agriculture. There are things are communities can do in these 15 minute cities like establishing greenhouses but school districts can also build gardens for the kids and community. The importance of regenerative agriculture is mentioned again, especially with how degraded our soil is getting.

This week, the Talk Guys discuss ""C40 cities"". A newer, more glossy, and polished term for 15-minute cities. The international criminal network behind these climate action plans continues to use propaganda to try and convince people that if the citizens of the world don‚Äôt stop consuming meat and dairy while giving up cars and travel involving short-haul flights, the world will end in a matter of months, much like they‚Äôve been saying since the 1970s. 14 American cities are on this list (thankfully none in Iowa), including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Miami, Seattle, and Portland, just to name a few of the usual suspects. Once again, elites like former NYC Mayor Bloomberg, who is funding part of this plan, know what‚Äôs best for the peasants. While having zero intent on practicing what they preach.

Join your hosts, Theo, Teepee, and Erock, as they go over the current and past events that have led to the interesting times we are living in today and why you should probably care.

While hiding from the RCMP, the Big Blue Orc left the Corporation of the Shire with a looming $227 million loss in their budget. The Mayor prepared his best pitch as Townhall meetings were booked in each of the Shire's wards and across the nation. He hoped these meetings would help convince the people to cover the million-dollar loss created by the Big Blue Orc's broken promise. Can Carly of Klassen and the Elder Elves do anything about the Housing Cost Crisis and will the Big Blue Orc ever ‚Äúmake them whole‚Äù?

M3hAwhhbk8A,3,2023-11-12,Episode 33: The Cities of the Future,"For many, COVID-19 will change the way we look at work forever. This week on The Agenda podcast with Stephen Cole we look at how the pandemic has changed where we work and also where we live.¬†


First on the podcast we speak to Carlos Moreno, professor at the Sorbonne and scientific advisor to the Mayor of Paris. He is a driving force behind the concept of the 15-minute city: a city where you can live, work and play all within a 15-minute walk.¬†


He tells us why this concept could change the way planners look at designing cities [02:00]. He also explains why this concept has taken so long to introduce and what needs to happen on a planning level in order to make it a reality [05:19].


Across Europe, and especially in Britain, out-of-town countryside homes are suddenly selling at a premium, as working from home means you no longer need to worry about how long it takes to commute to the office.


We spoke to Anna White, the lead property writer for London's Evening Standard newspaper, who tells us why life outside the city could be the answer for millions post-pandemic.¬† She explains why Britain is in a ‚Äúmicro-boom‚Äù in terms of real-estate prices and why it won‚Äôt last [10:56]. She also predicts a regeneration of the British high street as people become tired of working from home in the long term [13:20].¬†",1,episode 33 city future many covid 19 change way look work forever week agenda podcast stephen cole look pandemic ha changed work also live first podcast speak carlos moreno professor sorbonne scientific advisor mayor paris driving force behind concept 15 minute city city live work play within 15 minute walk tell u concept could change way planner look designing city 02 00 also explains concept ha taken long introduce need happen planning level order make reality 05 19 across europe especially britain town countryside home suddenly selling premium working home mean longer need worry long take commute office spoke anna white lead property writer london evening standard newspaper tell u life outside city could answer million post pandemic explains britain micro boom term real estate price last 10 56 also predicts regeneration british high street people become tired working home long term 13 20,0.0,0,True,

U1cdS1ZLYG8,3,2023-11-19,How compact should my city be? Matteo Bruno,"Research: How compact should my city be?

The quest for the ‚Äúideal‚Äù cities was carried on for two centuries by urbanists, wondering how cities ‚Äúshould‚Äù look like. Complex systems and the explosion of available data made this quest reappear and boosted it with renewed theories. The 15-minute city, in particular, heralded a new vision for cities where essential services must be easily accessible in less than 15 minutes by walking.. In this talk I‚Äôll examine the feasibility and practicability of this concept in many cities worldwide. I will show how close cities are to the ideal of the 15-minute city by measuring the accessibility times to resources and services, revealing a strong heterogeneity of accessibility within and across cities, with a significant role played by local population densities. Then, I'll show how much a better redistribution of resources and services could heal the inequality of accessibility, highlighting pronounced discrepancies among cities in the minimum number of services needed to become a 15-minute city. This brings evidence to the fact that the proximity-based paradigm must be generalised to work on a wide range of local population densities.


Discussion: Should I stay (in academia) or should I go (to a company)? 

This is a question that haunts many undergraduate and postgraduate students, or early career researchers. The issues of a lack of stability and the comparatively low salaries are felt by many of us and the alternatives seem a big compromise to our careers. 

I‚Äôll describe my experience working in a research laboratory which is private and funded by a company, talking about the pros and cons. Questions like ‚Äúhow free is it to do research?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo you have to get a profit?‚Äù arise naturally and there are some red flags to check when applying to a private research laboratory. 

Anyway, maybe the original question of academia vs company is a bit ill-posed and you should ask yourself something deeper, but it is a hard task to examine the possibilities without fully knowing what exactly comes with them. However, we often tend to forget the possibility to go back and change trajectory.

4N6lr3tZuQE,3,2023-11-26,Towards harnessing OpenStreetMap for Climate Action,"As we all and especially urban areas grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, the need for effective strategies and tools to promote climate action readiness and sustainable urban development has become paramount. This talk explores the potential of OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a powerful platform for generating high-resolution spatial indicators that facilitate climate action, support urban planning and in particular the vision of a 15-Minute City. This is based on a new major project at https://HeiGIT.org, that shall support developing relevant data, services and apps for the next years.
The concept of climate action readiness will be discussed, emphasizing the importance of assessing and understanding a city's preparedness to address climate change impacts. By harnessing the wealth of geospatial data available in OpenStreetMap, it becomes possible to derive spatial high-resolution indicators that reflect a city's climate action readiness, such as the distribution of renewable energy infrastructure, green spaces, and public transportation networks.
Also the potential of OSM for realising the concept of a 15-Minute City will be discussed. The 15-Minute City is an urban planning approach aimed at creating self-sufficient neighbourhoods where residents can access most essential services and amenities within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Leveraging OpenStreetMap's data and tools like https://openrouteservice.org, it is possible to calculate and visualise the 15-minute accessibility of various amenities, including schools, healthcare facilities, grocery stores, and recreational areas. These indicators enable urban planners and policymakers to identify gaps in accessibility, prioritise infrastructure investments, and promote sustainable and equitable urban development. Openrouteservice by HeiGIT.org has already been used for many accessibility analyses, especially the global open healthcare access map based on OSM, which is a first example of analysing access to relevant public infrastructure. https://apps.heigit.org/healthcare_access/
The talk will showcase first examples and case studies where OpenStreetMap has been utilized to generate high-resolution spatial indicators for climate action readiness. It will discuss how the integration of OSM data with advanced analytical techniques and visualisation can empower decision-makers and communities to make informed choices and take proactive measures towards climate action and the realisation of a 15-Minute City.
By utilizing OpenStreetMap's collaborative and open nature, this talk will advocate for democratising geospatial data and its critical role in advancing climate action efforts. It will inspire participants to leverage OSM as a powerful tool for generating valuable insights, fostering community engagement, and promoting sustainable urban development in the face of climate change.
While OSM has a diverse community contributing to its dataset, variations in data coverage and quality across different regions can pose challenges when utilizing OSM for climate action planning. The talk will emphasize the need to understand the limitations and biases associated with OSM data and to adopt appropriate strategies to address data gaps.
To tackle these challenges, the presentation will also give an overview of services like https://ohsome.org by the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT). These services provide tools and methodologies for analysing OSM data quality, including assessing data completeness and identifying data gaps. By leveraging such services, climate action planners can gain insights into the reliability of OSM data in specific regions, enabling them to make informed decisions and augment missing data through targeted mapping efforts.
Local community mapping initiatives in OSM for climate action planning are key for the success of such undertaking. They contribute firsthand knowledge and can address data gaps, particularly in underrepresented areas. By collaborating with communities and supporting capacity building, OSM can become a more inclusive and comprehensive platform for generating climate action indicators and promoting sustainable urban development.
We emphasise the need for partnerships with local stakeholders to enhance data quality, accessibility, and coverage in underrepresented regions. By addressing these challenges and capitalising on the strengths of OSM, the community can leverage the platform to foster climate action readiness.",22,towards harnessing openstreetmap climate action especially urban area grapple challenge posed climate change need effective strategy tool promote climate action readiness sustainable urban development ha become paramount talk explores potential openstreetmap osm powerful platform generating high resolution spatial indicator facilitate climate action support urban planning particular vision 15 minute city based new major project shall support developing relevant data service apps next year concept climate action readiness discussed emphasizing importance assessing understanding city preparedness address climate change impact harnessing wealth geospatial data available openstreetmap becomes possible derive spatial high resolution indicator reflect city climate action readiness distribution renewable energy infrastructure green space public transportation network also potential osm realising concept 15 minute city discussed 15 minute city urban planning approach aimed creating self sufficient neighbourhood resident access essential service amenity within 15 minute walk bike ride leveraging openstreetmap data tool like possible calculate visualise 15 minute accessibility various amenity including school healthcare facility grocery store recreational area indicator enable urban planner policymakers identify gap accessibility prioritise infrastructure investment promote sustainable equitable urban development openrouteservice heigit org ha already used many accessibility analysis especially global open healthcare access map based osm first example analysing access relevant public infrastructure talk showcase first example case study openstreetmap ha utilized generate high resolution spatial indicator climate action readiness discus integration osm data advanced analytical technique visualisation empower decision maker community make informed choice take proactive measure towards climate action realisation 15 minute city utilizing openstreetmap collaborative open nature talk advocate democratising geospatial data critical role advancing climate action effort inspire participant leverage osm powerful tool generating valuable insight fostering community engagement promoting sustainable urban development face climate change osm ha diverse community contributing dataset variation data coverage quality across different region pose challenge utilizing osm climate action planning talk emphasize need understand limitation bias associated osm data adopt appropriate strategy address data gap tackle challenge presentation also give overview service like heidelberg institute geoinformation technology heigit service provide tool methodology analysing osm data quality including assessing data completeness identifying data gap leveraging service climate action planner gain insight reliability osm data specific region enabling make informed decision augment missing data targeted mapping effort local community mapping initiative osm climate action planning key success undertaking contribute firsthand knowledge address data gap particularly underrepresented area collaborating community supporting capacity building osm become inclusive comprehensive platform generating climate action indicator promoting sustainable urban development emphasise need partnership local stakeholder enhance data quality accessibility coverage underrepresented region addressing challenge capitalising strength osm community leverage platform foster climate action readiness,2.0,0,False,

bNe8qwpLYEY,3,2023-11-26,Advice  How the suburbs could become 15-minute cities,"Cities are in a hurry. Many are declaring themselves 15-minute metros, promising access to housing, shopping, schools and jobs within a 15-minute-or-so walk, bike or transit ride. And who wouldn‚Äôt want to live nearly next door to life‚Äôs pleasures and necessities? Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo campaigned on the premise. Sydney has proclaimed itself a 20-minute metro (Melbourne is aiming for a more modest 30 minutes). In the United States, cities including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Cleveland are embracing the concept, while Portland‚Äôs Complete Neighborhoods and Eugene‚Äôs ‚Äú20-minute living‚Äù are putting their own spin on the idea in Oregon. But the 15-minute city ‚Äî as it is often understood ‚Äî has inspired fierce pushback. In its journey from urban planning circles to the public arena, some have falsely claimed it will imprison people within a 15-minute radius of their homes (it‚Äôs about convenience and freedom, advocates argue, not isolation). Some urban planners object to the idea. They say that not everyone‚Äôs workplace can be within a 15 minute walk, shrinking a metropolitan area‚Äôs job market. But amid smoldering housing and climate crises, the 15-minute-city concept offers a way out of both, reducing our dependence on cars to go about our daily lives and freeing us to spend our time as we choose. To realize this, we need to look to an unlikely place: the first suburbs. Throughout recorded human history, less than 5 percent of people lived in cities. But in the relative blink of an eye, this situation reversed. People began leaving the countryside in droves during the Industrial Revolution. By 2008, the urban population had eclipsed the rural one. The gap continues to widen. Seventy percent of the world‚Äôs population is expected to live in cities by 2050. Urban migration has supercharged human prosperity: An estimated 80 percent of the world‚Äôs economic activity now occurs in cities.  This has  reduced per capita environmental impact in some high-income nations. City dwellers emit as much as 20 percent less compared to their rural counterparts, largely thanks to more efficient transport, heating and cooking, according to studies in the United Kingdom, Finland, Austria and Switzerland. But cities are staggering under their success. Congestion and unaffordability are  pushing people from many cities into expensive housing in far suburbs or exurbs. Vehicles have been the leading source of greenhouse gases in the United States since 2017. Few things exemplify this trajectory better than commuting in the United States. American commuters spent an average of about an hour each day driving to work in 2019, the vast majority alone, up from 44 minutes in 1980 (the pandemic put only a slight dent in these numbers). Few enjoy it. When 900 Texas women were asked to rate their feelings about daily activities, the morning commute came in dead last ‚Äî after work and household chores.

rzY_M4-x11I,3,2023-12-10,15 Minute Cities Research - An Overview,"An overview of the research I am undertaking in regards to 15 minute cities.

Please note 15 minute cities and 20 minute neighbourhoods are the same - 15 minute cities focus on cities, 20 minute neighbourhoods focus on more rural areas, including towns.

This includes the policies from both local councils and the UK government which lay the groundwork for this concept. I note these up into a form which is easier for everyone to read, and upload them so that anyone can see what is happening. These include:

Local Gov:
- Local Plans
- Transport Plans
- Local Walking and Cycling Infrastructure Plans
- Climate Action Plans

UK Gov policies include:
- Gear Change (1 & 2)
- Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans
- Local Walking and Cycling Infrastructure Plan Guidance
- Transport Visions
Plus more....

Every UK council have or are bringing in policies that lay out the groundwork for 15 minute cities/ 20 minute neighbourhoods. This includes active travel measures (walking and cycling), sustainable transport priority, sustainable development and more. 

It is worth taking a look at your own council, if you have time, to see how far they have got with this. Although I do aim to note up all UK council documents relating to this, it will take a long time.

More videos to come soon, including on individual council documents which I have completed so far...

iRfbrkMQAqk,3,2024-01-07,What Are 15-Minute Cities and Why Do Conservatives Hate Them?,"Imagine a city where everything you need is just a short distance away. What many would consider ideal, right-wingers are calling ‚Äôtyrannical‚Äô ‚Äî here‚Äôs why.

What are 15 minute cities? The 15-minute city envisions a community where essential amenities are within a short walk or bike ride. This envision has been embraced by 16 cities worldwide with the city of Paris becoming a pioneer in this movement. The city has went on to implement over 600 miles of protected bike lanes and green spaces to foster sustainability and combat traffic congestion.

Inspired by the 15-minute city plan in Paris, Cleveland's mayor is pacing towards a plan to reshape the city, emphasizing healthier and more connected living spaces. Despite the positive impacts observed globally, not everyone supports this vision. Influential figures like Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson, particularly in conservative circles, criticize the idea as tyrannical.

Contrary to the opposition's views, the 15-minute city model is about empowerment rather than constraint. It seeks to create communities where accessibility flourishes, local economies thrive, and people enjoy easy access to necessities without lengthy commutes or large carbon footprints.

The concept isn't entirely new, as cities like Paris, Venice, and New York were originally designed for compact accessibility. Today's 15-minute city expands horizons, fostering sustainable, tight-knit neighborhoods where life, work, and leisure coexist within a limited radius.

QGI0bTfkGI8,3,2024-01-07,How Did The 15 Minute City Become a Conspiracy Theory?,"If you're a fan of this podcast, then you'll no doubt be aware of our fan of smart urban design. ¬†


For years the car guided how we designed and built our cities. ¬†The idea was that we would alway require a car to get from place to place where we live. ¬†Spawl became a way of life and almost official policy for development in the 905. ¬†In recent years however, sprawl has become problematic. ¬†We have come around to the notion that we cannot keep building over greenspace to accomodate the growth that the region is experience.


So what does that mean for our cities? ¬†Well, for urban planner policy wonks, the notion of a city where the vital amenities of life would be within walking distance of our homes began to take hold. ¬†Thus came the idea of the 15 minute city. ¬†Groceries, doctors offices, small businesses, clinics etc, would all be within a 15 minute walk of one's home. ¬†Is this doable? We honestly don't know. ¬†But as a utopian goal for us collectively to build our cities around, it seemed like an interesting idea. ¬†It's entirely a policy wonk's fevered dream.


Which is why we found it ridiculous to find it coming up in Op-Eds and rallies by the far right as an evil plot by the World Economic Forum. ¬†That this was just another step in an evil move by the WEF, or George Soros or whichever boogeyman you want to substitute into the argument to put us in manageable pens and fenced off districts to limit our movements. ¬†All of which is laughably ludicrous and not true.


However, in the world post-pandemic these conspiracy theories have a life of their own and often tend to poison discourse around good ideas. ¬†We didn't want that to happen to the 15 minute city. ¬†In that spirit we reached out to former guest of the podcast Glyn Bowerman of Spacing Radio to come on to discuss how we got here, and how we can work to keep the 15 minute city from becoming a bad word in politics.

En un mundo cada vez m√°s urbanizado, las ciudades enfrentan desaf√≠os crecientes relacionados con la movilidad, la sostenibilidad y la calidad de vida de sus habitantes. En este sentido, una propuesta innovadora que ha ganado tracci√≥n es el concepto de ""Ciudades de 15 minutos"". 
Este concepto fue desarrollado por el urbanista francocolombiano Carlos Moreno y busca transformar la manera en que vivimos, reorganizando las √°reas urbanas para que los residentes accedan a todos los servicios y comodidades esenciales a una distancia de 15 minutos a pie o en bicicleta desde su hogar. La idea es dise√±ar ciudades que requieran menor uso de autom√≥viles, donde las personas pasen menos tiempo en el tr√°fico y caminar o andar en bici sea mucho m√°s conveniente.
No obstante, esta propuesta disruptiva ha encontrado resistencia por parte de algunas personas que aseguran que es parte de una conspiraci√≥n, un plan secreto de control social que busca confinarnos y limitar nuestras libertades, pese a que la idea de las ciudades de 15 minutos es precisamente dar m√°s tiempo y mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas.

What makes a city beautiful, livable, walkable, and simply a desirable place to call home? And on the other side, what mistakes can destroy a city‚Äôs appeal to residents, visitors, and investors? For the last six years, Cal Poly Assistant Professor of City and Regional Planning Dave Amos has been exploring answers to these questions through his hugely popular YouTube channel, City Beautiful. The channel embraces a mantra: that cities are amazing, and then seeks to understand what makes some cities succeed while others stumble. Amos‚Äô inquisitive, fast-paced, and approachable style has earned his channel more than 651,000 subscribers, with his videos about cities and city planning regularly attracting millions of views. Amos has explored what happened when cities banned cars, why high-rise public housing projects were once thought to be part of the answer to America‚Äôs chronic housing projects, and even what urban planning looking like in the former Soviet Union.

La idea es dise√±ar ciudades que requieran menor uso de autom√≥viles, donde las personas pasen menos tiempo en el tr√°fico y caminar o andar en bici sea mucho m√°s conveniente.
No obstante, esta propuesta disruptiva ha encontrado resistencia por parte de algunas personas que aseguran que es parte de una conspiraci√≥n, un plan secreto de control social que busca confinarnos y limitar nuestras libertades, pese a que la idea de las ciudades de 15 minutos es precisamente dar m√°s tiempo y mejorar la calidad de vida de las personas.

People who should know better don't want to talk about it. 46% of Dutch commuters have a +30 minute trip to work. If passenger transport for trips longer than 15 minutes wasn't a daily necessity in every modern economic system, North Korea would've figured it out by now.

About the podcast: Echoes of the Valley explores the intricate relationship between transportation, the environment, and the profound influence of two periods and two communities in Edmonton, Alberta's capital city. Cohosts Eylse Colville and Emily Homeniuk examine the historical significance of Edmonton's North Saskatchewan River Valley, the challenges it faced during late 1960s, and the activists who worked to protect the valley. Building on this historical backdrop, Colville and Homeniuk discuss the contemporary 15-minute community movement and the push-back this neighbourhood model received.

Warum Verschw√∂rungstheoretiker*innen damit ein Problem haben, was echte Nachteile sein k√∂nnten, warum wir die 15-minute city aber trotzdem gut finden, erkl√§ren wir im ersten Teil.

Step into a world where the allure of 15-minute cities clashes with the potential for manipulation and control. In this episode, we unravel the intriguing narrative of self-contained urban paradises, questioning whether they hold the promise of utopia or the grip of dystopia. Delve deep into the dynamics of rural resistance and urban conformity, as we analyze the tactics used to entice communities and shape AI-driven governance. But that's not all ‚Äì we also journey back to the lessons learned from the initial wave of COVID, a wakeup call that still reverberates in our present. Uncover the ten crucial insights that empower us to challenge tyranny, misinformation, and the quest for control.

The city is to be called Bradfield City and will be built next to the Western Sydney Airport.

The idea is residents will be able to jump on public transport and access all amenities within half an hour.

Mr Antic‚Äôs comments come as Sydney plans to unveil a brand new 30-minute city.

‚ÄúThe reality is this is steeped in all the language of a socialist climate agenda,‚Äù he told Sky News host Rita Panahi.

‚ÄúBy the way, these are cities which allow us to be turnkey communities.

‚ÄúIf all of a sudden you can‚Äôt go further or you don‚Äôt need to go further than 15 minutes in either direction in order to do what you need to do, then it‚Äôs very easy in some cities to simply make it very hard for anyone to leave when the time comes.

For example: let‚Äôs say the system doesn‚Äôt want you to drink alcohol. If your SMART toilet detects drugs in your urine, the SMART lock system can lock you in your apartment.

Prophetic Insight Series 198: 15-Minute City in the System of the Image of the Beast

I saw that the remnant were not prepared for what is coming upon the earth. Stupidity, like lethargy, seemed to hang upon the minds of most of those who profess to believe that we are having the last message. My accompanying angel cried out with awful solemnity, ""Get ready! get ready! get ready! for the fierce anger of the Lord is soon to come. His wrath is to be poured out, unmixed with mercy, and ye are not ready. ‚Äî EW 119.1

God never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan's constant resort‚Äîto gain control of those whom he cannot otherwise seduce‚Äîis compulsion by cruelty. Through fear or force he endeavors to rule the conscience and to secure homage to himself. To accomplish this, he works through both religious and secular authorities, moving them to the enforcement of human laws in defiance of the law of God. ‚Äî GC 591.2

They were encouraged to steadfastness by the words of Paul, ""Cast not away therefore your confidence;"" ""ye have need of patience;"" ""for yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry."" Their ONLY SAFE course was to cherish the light which they had already received of God, HOLD FAST TO HIS PROMISES, and CONTINUE TO SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES, and PATIENTLY WAIT and WATCH TO RECEIVE FURTHER LIGHT. ‚Äî GC88 407.2

ZHIs2rqpijc,3,2024-03-03,What is a 15 Minute Neighborhood/City ?,"As a planning concept, the goal tries to help people to get around without need of a car.¬† 

¬† A recent article (The 15-Minute City, Deconstructed, March 8, 2023 (https://www.archdaily.com/997690/the-15-minute-city-deconstructed) ) talks about what a 15-minute city is and what it includes.¬†

‚ÄúIt's measure is simply this: how far can you walk or bike in 15 minutes? So, the 15-Minute City of one of your neighbors a couple blocks away is slightly different from your 15-Minute City. And it‚Äôs not a question of how far you‚Äôre able to travel, but rather of how far you‚Äôre willing to travel on foot or bike based on risks.‚Äù¬†

The article lists important ‚Äúdestinations‚Äù for a 15-minute neighborhood, using your front door as the starting point. Each ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù in then unique, dependent on where is your ""front door.‚Äù ¬†

As an experiment, I used Google Maps to locate the following destinations from my front door, then used the Get Directions function to determine the distance (miles) and then the time to walk and bike to each destination. ¬†

Hello and thank you for taking the time to watch my video. I hope you enjoyed it. In this video I look around the Old World, visiting a 1800's 15 minute city, Port Sunlight, and discuss the possibilities surrounding Satan's season while looking at a beautiful old world society. This village could have been a token gesture to entice the population into submitting to a corporative and industrialist future. Or it could have been a founded village that was built before the claimed date and has been provided with a His-Story. In this video, I discuss the token gesture element since I don't think that should be forgotten. I am Kath Ede, I write fiction, mainly apocalyptic in nature. I have been interested in mainstream and alternative theories in this realm and I try to bring in those theories and experiences into my work.

Steven Guilbeault, the Climate Minister of Canada, has been a prominent figure in the global effort to combat climate change. Known for his strong advocacy for environmental protection, Guilbeault has made it his mission to push for policies that reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability.

One of Guilbeault's key initiatives is his ""war on cars"" campaign, which aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuel-powered vehicles and promote the adoption of electric and other environmentally friendly modes of transportation. This initiative reflects Guilbeault's understanding of the significant contribution that the transportation sector makes to greenhouse gas emissions, and his determination to address this issue.

Guilbeault's approach to tackling climate change is not limited to just one area, but encompasses a comprehensive and holistic strategy. He understands that addressing climate change requires a multi-faceted approach that includes reducing emissions from various sources, promoting renewable energy, conserving natural habitats, and more.

As Canada's Climate Minister, Guilbeault's influence extends beyond his home country. He has been an active participant in international climate negotiations and has worked to build partnerships with other countries to collectively address the climate crisis.

It is clear that Steven Guilbeaultis a passionate and determined advocate for climate action. His ""war on cars"" initiative is just one example of his commitment to finding innovative and effective solutions to combat climate change. As the world continues to grapple with the impacts of a changing climate, leaders like Guilbeault are essential in driving meaningful and impactful change.

We're looking at the myths that the UK government is trying to spread about it, and why coworking spaces are so important in terms of creating community, encouraging people to walk to work, and connecting people to each other.¬†



Basically, 15-minute cities mean you can get to all your places in just 15 minutes, whether it's a bike ride or a walk.¬†



In this episode, we have David Brown (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrown/) , the mastermind behind The Good Space (https://goodspace.work/)  - a coworking spot that's all about the 15-Minute City concept.¬†¬†



He's all about the concept of 15-minute Cities, where everything you need is just a short walk away. He talks about how this idea was born out of his desire to help local businesses and get rid of the need to commute.¬†



He also explains why coworking is more than just a place to work - it's a place where people can connect and build relationships.¬†



Plus, he talks about how the coworking scene is thriving in London right now, the safety measures that have been put in place, and the impact remote work is having on the industry.¬†



Finally, he talks about why coworking is so important - it's about shared spaces, community, and increased productivity.

3GjSu1jdzxc,3,2024-03-24,Sunday Law Alert: Project 2025 | 15-minute cities | Ai and Aliens,"Now with all the prophetic signs happening around the world from record setting extreme weather and 19 Volcanoes erupting at once, new global pandemics on the horizon, serious governmental discussions about UFOs, nuero link implanted brain chips, wars and rumors of war particularly in Israel with the threat of that conflict expanding along with the war in Russia and Ukraine could spark WW3 and a potential nuclear exchange has set the stage for the greatest Harvest the world has ever known. 

But there are many who have been revealing that there are new ideals, new music, new definitions of sin and even a rejection of the Spirit of Prophecy among many, so our churches look more like the churches of the world than the peculiar people we have been called to be. 

For Mrs. White says it will have an effect upon the heart of the receiver and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear it and will rise up against it creating every wicked wind of doctrine and this is what will cause the shaking among God‚Äôs people. And this is exactly what the church must go through so we will transform from the church militant to the church triumphant! 

And if these Wicked Winds of deception have crept into our churches how much more is the deception in the world?

Remember most Christians and especially those outside the church have no clue as to what the Mark of the Beast really is. 

And Satan is not coming with a pitchfork, horns and 666 tattooed on his forehead he is much more intelligent than that. No 2 Corinthians 11:14 says he is coming as an Angel of Light because Satan wants to be worshiped, in fact he wants the entire world to worship him as god. But in order for Satan to bring the world to its knees so it will bow before him on the counterfeit Sabbath he must first try and bring about three things.

Now church, understand. You cannot give away what you do not possess so I want to bring to light three Wicked Winds of Deception happening here and around the globe quickly leading to a One world Government, One world Economy, and One World Religion. That is what I will be speaking about in this video.

Full story: 
Heavy boots caused thuds and creaks to escape the dusty floor. The group hurriedly walked to the table, leaving a dust cloud in their wake. The center man, was larger than the rest, but his hands cupped a delicate object as if holding a newborn. The rest gathered around the table as he placed the object in the center. The room grew silent, staring timidly, both in fear and awe of what lay in front of them. Sweat was dripping down nearly all their brows, mixing with the dust and leaving brown mud trails on their skin. One of the group members lifted a hand holding a lighter, and in one smooth motion, flicked the light on. In the center of the table was a scroll, even rolled up, it appeared translucent as if it could turn into dust itself at any moment. The largest of the group finally reached over through the thick silence and rolled the scroll open. Every line revealed on the scroll made the group‚Äôs eyes grow larger and larger with excitement. It was a map, clear as day‚Ä¶well not these days, but as clear as days of the past. Names written over mountain ranges, grid lines for measuring distance, even a compass at the bottom right to give a reference point. Finally, a voice broke the silence. A woman‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúGuess Max was right, this will lead us to the city of beyond.‚Äù Her voice was firm and strong, she had learned to make it that way over years of leading this small group of survivors. The most rebellious of the group retorted, ‚ÄúMax always talked about dreams and visions, are you supposed to have us believe that this place really exists? I say no, look around Capt, the world went to shit a long time ago and there is no secret world, it‚Äôs pfft, pixy dust, nothing, nada, zip, it was all in his head and we are gonna end up just like him if we keep going down this path, DE-‚Äù His words were cut short as the burly man known as Rodrigo, lifted Sammy straight off his feet. ‚ÄúRodrigo it's okay, you can put him down.‚Äù Rodrigo dropped the man but never took his mean glare off him. Sammy stayed silent but massaged his neck in pain. ‚ÄúSammy is just tired, we all are, I don't blame him‚Ä¶but this map is all the proof I need. I‚Äôve asked so much from all of you and if the scale is right on this map‚Ä¶.we are in for one hell of a journey‚Ä¶So I want to make it clear, I intend to pursue the city of beyond at ALL cost. Those who do not feel the same, you are freed from my command and all outstanding debts. Those who stay with me, I promise you an equal share of any riches we find.‚Äù The group of men shuffled and murmured in quiet discussion. Their concerned voices grew louder. Rodrigo was the first to step forward, silent in his action, but everyone knew he was in. Sammy surprisingly stepped forward to, ‚Äúscrew it, if we are gonna die, it might as well not be in this hell hole.‚Äù Soon more and more of the group stepped forward until they were all standing amidst the Capt. ‚ÄúWell gentlemen, grab your goggles, shovels, and any water, we have a city to find.‚Äù

In the United States, cities including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Cleveland are putting a spin on the concept of 15 minute cities. The 15-minute city is an urban planning concept that, as its name suggests, aims to create communities where people can access key amenities by travelling no more than 15 minutes on foot or by bike. As of march 2023 There are already 16 cities worldwide that have implemented the 15-minute city concept or similar ideas. those who are trying to implement this is concerned about combating climate change.
Lowering the emission, pollution and to become much more greener are the concerns of creating 15 minute cities.

Can 15 minute cities work in the US properly? Lately this topic is getting a lot of pushback due to the conspiracy of the 15 minute cities. Some think it is a way to keep the masses self contained by limiting our ability to travel and go places via vehicles. With more and more restriction comes into play regarding traveling. These 15 minute cities will start serving it purpose.

Embark on a riveting journey with Info Central as we navigate the intricacies of the 15-Minute City‚Äîan architectural revolution reshaping the urban landscape. Our investigative lens zooms in on this emerging concept, promising a life where every need is a mere quarter-hour away.

What unfolds in these condensed habitats? Do they herald a renaissance of community living and environmental stewardship, or are we stepping into a controlled realm, a subtle matrix that tightens its grip under the guise of progress? Join us as we uncover the silent undercurrents of surveillance, governance, and social dynamics.

From the illustrious streets of Paris to the experimental blocks of Melbourne and the corridors of Portland, the 15-Minute City ignites debates and passions alike. Critics voice concerns of societal divides and digital shackles, even as proponents sing praises of convenience and reduced carbon footprints.

With a vigilant eye, Info Central questions the delicate balance between the idyllic allure of self-sufficiency and the looming shadow of an omnipresent watch. Our critical analysis probes the layers that may dictate not just where we live, but how we live in the near future.

This is more than a discussion about city planning; it's a conversation about the essence of freedom and identity in our ever-evolving societies.

HtLn8YVvp_E,3,2024-04-07,Seattle's 15-minute makeover,"Who killed the 15-minute city? And what will it take to get it back?
 

Seattle leaders have a plan to turn NIMBYs into YIMBYs. They're betting they can get residents to say ""yes in my back yard"" to growth if Seattle becomes a 15-minute city. That means changing laws so that everything you need is a 15-minute walk, bike, or bus ride from your home. This week on Booming, we travel to Georgetown, which could become a 15-minute neighborhood under Seattle's new Comprehensive Plan.
 

Plus, local content creators are sounding off on federal lawmakers' plan to ban TikTok if it doesn't cut ties with its Chinese parent company. And producer Lucy Soucek makes her Booming debut to share what listeners say is missing from their ideal 15-minute neighborhoods.

The UCP's Bill 20 opens the door for municipal political parties, restores union and corporate donations, and empowers the province to remove elected councillors (when it's ""in the public interest""). Question is, are the changes good or bad for democracy? What do they mean for the average Albertan? Back by popular demand...it's our Group Chat Round Table! 

2:10 | Jenny Adams, Sarah Hamilton, and Jarrett Campbell take on municipal political parties (10:00), the return of union and corporate donations (26:05), the power to fire city councillors (29:00), Bill 18 - the Provincial Priorities Act (31:10), Pierre Poilievre's roadside photo op (34:00), and the Alberta NDP leadership race (48:30). 

57:00 | Gabriel sounds off on 15 Minute Cities, James is nervous about the feds selling TMX, and Angela has a message for Alberta's duly-elected mayors and councillors. It's The Flamethrower presented by the DQs of Northwest Edmonton and Sherwood Park!

4/19/2024 -- Sponsored by the NJ Climate Change Resource Center https://njclimateresourcecenter.rutgers.edu/

The 15-minute neighborhood concept gained visibility as the global pandemic demonstrated that local access to basic life needs is critically important. In addition to being an important contribution to New Jersey‚Äôs efforts to achieve its goals of reducing pollution that causes climate change, 15-minute neighborhoods provide residents with easy access to parks, schools, gathering places, social services, places to buy healthy fresh food, and, in some cases, public transit, within a comfortable walk or bike ride.

Near-term, multi-billion-dollar investments in infrastructure, a revolution in transportation technologies not seen in a century, the recalibration of relationships between people and places brought about by the pandemic, and converging policies related to energy, health, climate, transportation, and environmental justice provide New Jersey with an unprecedented opportunity to rethink and adjust how we design and build communities.

Join Jon Carnegie, Executive Director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, for a summary of a two-year study designed to investigate how a comprehensive, multi-goal planning and policy framework can be used to achieve carbon-neutral transportation choices that simultaneously support healthy, just, and resilient communities for all New Jersey residents.

The concept of a 15 Minute City (FMC) has gained significant traction as urban planners and developers seek to create more sustainable and livable communities. At its core, the FMC concept revolves around the idea of designing neighborhoods where residents can access essential services, amenities, and activities within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their homes. Let's explore how this concept can be applied to the historic Baltimore neighborhoods of Upton and Harlem Park, along with the role Marc Hayes can play in this transformation.

### Understanding the 15 Minute City Concept

The 15 Minute City is a vision for urban development that promotes walkability, accessibility, and community engagement. It aims to reduce reliance on cars, minimize commuting times, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents. Key elements of a 15 Minute City include:

1. **Mixed-Use Development:** Integrating residential, commercial, and recreational spaces to create vibrant and diverse neighborhoods.
2. **Access to Essential Services:** Ensuring easy access to grocery stores, healthcare facilities, schools, parks, and public transportation.
3. **Pedestrian and Bike-Friendly Infrastructure:** Designing streets and pathways that prioritize pedestrians and cyclists, making it safe and convenient to navigate the neighborhood without a car.
4. **Community Engagement:** Encouraging local businesses, cultural institutions, and community centers to thrive, fostering a sense of belonging and connection among residents.

### History of Upton and Harlem Park

Upton and Harlem Park are historically rich neighborhoods in Baltimore with a strong cultural heritage. Upton, once home to prominent African American leaders and artists, has faced challenges such as disinvestment, vacant properties, and economic disparities. Harlem Park, known for its beautiful Victorian-style homes, has also experienced issues related to blight and limited economic opportunities.

### Required Development for Transformation

To turn Upton and Harlem Park into a thriving 15 Minute City, several development initiatives are crucial:

1. **Revitalizing Vacant Properties:** Repurposing vacant buildings into affordable housing, mixed-use developments, and community spaces to address housing needs and stimulate economic growth.
2. **Improving Infrastructure:** Upgrading sidewalks, adding bike lanes, enhancing public transportation options, and creating green spaces to promote active transportation and enhance the neighborhood's aesthetic appeal.
3. **Supporting Local Businesses:** Encouraging entrepreneurship, supporting small businesses, and attracting investments in retail and services that cater to residents' daily needs.
4. **Preserving Historic Character:** Balancing new development with the preservation of historic architecture and cultural landmarks to maintain the neighborhood's identity and sense of history.

### Marc Hayes: Partner in Transformation

Marc Hayes, a seasoned real estate professional with a deep understanding of Baltimore's real estate landscape, can play a pivotal role in transforming Upton and Harlem Park into a 15 Minute City:

1. **Investment Guidance:** Marc Hayes can assist investors in identifying strategic opportunities for development and investment in the neighborhoods, leveraging his expertise in market trends and property valuation.
2. **Development Consulting:** Working with developers, Marc Hayes can provide insights into zoning regulations, community engagement strategies, and project feasibility assessments to ensure successful and sustainable development projects.
3. **Resident Advocacy:** For potential residents, Marc Hayes can guide them through the home buying or renting process, highlighting the benefits of living in a 15 Minute City and connecting them with properties that meet their lifestyle preferences and needs.
4. **Community Collaboration:** Marc Hayes can facilitate collaborations between stakeholders, including local government, community organizations, and residents, to foster inclusive and community-driven development initiatives.

By embracing the principles of the 15 Minute City and leveraging Marc Hayes' expertise, Upton and Harlem Park can undergo a transformation that enhances livabiility, promotes economic prosperity, and creates a model for sustainable urban development in Baltimore.

GNS1PHCFM1E,3,2024-05-12,Breaking Boundaries: Navigating the Controversies of Smart Cities and 15-Minute Living!,"When you think of Smart Cities and 15-Minute Cities, you might envision futuristic landscapes where technology seamlessly blends with sustainability, offering efficient, eco-friendly urban environments. Imagine strolling down streets lined with greenery, with every essential amenity just a short walk or bike ride away. It‚Äôs a vision of urban life that promises convenience, connectivity, and environmental consciousness.

But as with any vision of the future, there are complexities and challenges beneath the surface. Dive into the world of Smart Cities, and you'll encounter a realm where 5G and artificial intelligence converge to create a network of interconnected devices and sensors. This network aims to enhance efficiency and quality of life, yet it sparks debates about privacy and surveillance concerns due to the vast collection of data.

Consider the ambitious Neom project in Saudi Arabia, which aims to build a sustainable, high-tech city with innovative green transportation solutions like flying taxis. While Neom showcases advanced infrastructure and a commitment to data-driven decision-making, it's also drawn criticism for the country's continued reliance on fossil fuel exports, highlighting a tension between environmental goals and economic interests.

Meanwhile, 15-Minute Cities advocate for a more human-centric approach to urban planning, emphasizing accessibility and reducing reliance on long commutes. However, critics worry about potential limitations on freedom of movement and privacy implications, raising questions about the balance between convenience and personal liberties.

Intriguingly, the concept of 15-Minute Cities has even sparked conspiracy theories, such as claims that wildfires in Maui were ignited by directed energy weapons as part of a government scheme to transform the island into a smart enclave. While these theories remain speculative, they underscore the significance of public perception and skepticism surrounding urban development initiatives.

As we navigate the discourse around Smart Cities and 15-Minute Cities, it's essential to recognize that these concepts are fluid and subject to revision. Some cities are reevaluating their plans, maintaining a focus on walkability while imposing restrictions on private vehicles in response to community feedback.

In conclusion, the journey towards realizing Smart Cities and 15-Minute Cities is multifaceted, marked by both promise and pitfalls. While these concepts offer potential for enhancing urban life, they also demand careful consideration of ethical, social, and environmental implications. Ultimately, striking a balance between innovation and individual freedoms will be crucial as we shape the cities of tomorrow.",6,breaking boundary navigating controversy smart city 15 minute living think smart city 15 minute city might envision futuristic landscape technology seamlessly blend sustainability offering efficient eco friendly urban environment imagine strolling street lined greenery every essential amenity short walk bike ride away vision urban life promise convenience connectivity environmental consciousness vision future complexity challenge beneath surface dive world smart city encounter realm 5g artificial intelligence converge create network interconnected device sensor network aim enhance efficiency quality life yet spark debate privacy surveillance concern due vast collection data consider ambitious neom project saudi arabia aim build sustainable high tech city innovative green transportation solution like flying taxi neom showcase advanced infrastructure commitment data driven decision making also drawn criticism country continued reliance fossil fuel export highlighting tension environmental goal economic interest meanwhile 15 minute city advocate human centric approach urban planning emphasizing accessibility reducing reliance long commute however critic worry potential limitation freedom movement privacy implication raising question balance convenience personal liberty intriguingly concept 15 minute city ha even sparked conspiracy theory claim wildfire maui ignited directed energy weapon part government scheme transform island smart enclave theory remain speculative underscore significance public perception skepticism surrounding urban development initiative navigate discourse around smart city 15 minute city essential recognize concept fluid subject revision city reevaluating plan maintaining focus walkability imposing restriction private vehicle response community feedback conclusion journey towards realizing smart city 15 minute city multifaceted marked promise pitfall concept offer potential enhancing urban life also demand careful consideration ethical social environmental implication ultimately striking balance innovation individual freedom crucial shape city tomorrow,0.0,0,False,

We kick things off with a discussion on Apple's controversial iPad ad, delving into how they attempts to showcase the creative potential of their latest gadget, and the resulting backlash. We then talk about Professor Carlos Moreno's innovative concept, the ""15-minute city"", which leverages hyper-local services to improve urban living. Shifting the focus to conservation and communication, we ponder the use of AI to decode sperm whale languages and what this could mean for our understanding of intelligence. Our deep dive into AI continues as we discuss OpenAI's stance on generating NSFW content and the regulatory measures that are in place to prevent misuse of this technology. Lastly, in an exciting turn of events, we talk music and voice AI as start-up company ElevenLabs unveils a model that generates song lyrics from prompts.

The difficulty in this run is that you have a deck with more face cards than usual (King, Queen, Jack), but you have an Eternal Joker that accumulates Mult and resets if you play a single face card! We also start with an Eternal Shortcut, which we eventually use to get a consistent Straight Flush build going, and we manage to get further into Endless Mode than we expected thanks to Mr Bones.

If you want to see more Balatro runs on this channel, feel free to like the video to let me know. I'd love to see what crazy Balatro runs you end up having.

This concept aims to reduce reliance on cars, decrease pollution, and improve overall quality of life by fostering compact, walkable neighborhoods.

As for biometric scans, they're increasingly used in various facets of life in China, from security checkpoints to mobile payments. Biometric technology, including facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and iris scans, is integrated into many aspects of daily life, facilitating convenience and efficiency in various transactions and services. However, the use of biometric data also raises concerns about privacy and surveillance, which have prompted debates and discussions about regulation and oversight.

Our co-host Francis Saele's teed up those controversial discussion topics for our guest, Sophie Wade on this week's What's Your Work Fit in the Workplace? Series Live Show.

Sophie is a globally recognized and respected work futurist, an expert on Gen Z and workplace, and the executive producer and host of the Transforming Work Podcast.

Referencing the thought-leadership of Darren Murph, John Riordan, and David Abrams on where we live and work, Sophie supported how CLDs, and perhaps the 15-Minute City, could help reduce commute times, allow more talent to easily work in a collocation, attain better workplace engagement, and achieve more work fit, where work becomes a wonderful part of the day doing other wonderful things.

Gen Z members do want IRL workplace engagement. That's how they learn the job, engage with others, and lead teams to achieve successful outcomes.

Greenland is a North American autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. It is the larger of two autonomous territories within the Kingdom, the other being the Faroe Islands; the citizens of both territories are full citizens of Denmark. As Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are European Union citizens. The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk. Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island, and is the location of the northernmost area of the world ‚Äì Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s.

While concepts like the 15-minute city, complete streets and car-free zones have positively impacted some cities, they may not suit all communities. A holistic approach involving land-use planning and mobility, coordinated across different levels of governance is essential. 

Implementation should focus on policies and financing to improve access and connectivity of peripherical areas through green infrastructure and clean, affordable, energy-efficient mobility. Low-carbon, connected regions can attract investment, fostering economic prosperity and social cohesion.

‚Ä¢ What are the necessary changes in governance structures, financing mechanisms, policy design, and regulatory frameworks to achieve integrated, inclusive, safe, active and sustainable urban and regional mobility planning?

‚Ä¢ How can policy measures promote subsidies to decarbonise public transport, including informal transport, making it affordable, clean and efficient, discouraging the use of individual motorised vehicles?

‚Ä¢ How can integrating technology and new mobility solutions enhance connectivity between cities and regions, fostering economic growth and improving quality of life?

76NXpp7lH-o,3,2024-06-09,Integrating Technology in Smart City Projects: A Semiotic Approach,"‚ÄúIntegrating Technology in Smart City Projects: A Semiotic Approach‚Äù
By Federico Bellentani 

Abstract:

In 1980, 39% of the global population, resided in cities. By 2015, this number had surged to 54% and projections indicate it will reach 66% by 2050. As cities expand and evolve, the push of technology plays a pivotal role in shaping urban life. However, the rapid integration of technology into urban environments often overlooks the nuanced meanings and interpretations of city dwellers. 

This presentation introduces a semiotic methodology for embedding technology in smart city projects, focusing on the significance of people‚Äôs meanings and interpretations. By leveraging urban semiotics, it proposes a human-centered approach to smart city development that harmonizes technological advancements with the cultural and social fabric of urban populations. 

This semiotic framework advocates for a participatory process where technological solutions are not merely imposed but are thoughtfully integrated based on the local contexts, values and practices of urban communities. This approach aims to enhance human experiences, foster inclusive and sustainable communities and ensure that technological progress supports human well-being and agency. 

This presentation will contribute to an extended theoretical toolkit for studying cities as semiotic entities, considering also the contributions included in the edited book Semiotics approaches to urban space (by Bellentani, Panico & Yoka, Edward Elgar Publishing),and provide practical suggestions for integrating technology in ways that enhance the lived experiences of urban populations.

A voice from the speaker said, ‚ÄúACB134...wake up! 
ACB134 said, ""Mommy, is that you."" 
Mommy replied, ""Yes, it is me. Today's date is July 6, 2052. Wake up and get ready for work. Today is the big day. Remember what you will do and go with the rebels. Would you like Cricket-Os or Grasshopper Crunch for breakfast?""
ACB134 gets out of his bed and makes it, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Grasshopper Crunch for breakfast.‚Äù ACB134 decides to take a quick shower before he eats breakfast.
ACB134 gets out of the shower, puts his work clothes on, and sits down to eat breakfast, ‚ÄúYum, Grasshopper Crunch!‚Äù After he eats, he takes his bowl to the sink for the machine to clean it.
Mommy says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget the stick that has the plans for the rebels.‚Äù
ACB134 replies, ‚ÄúYes Mommy, I have it.‚Äù
ACB134 heads out the door to go work in the maintenance area. Every time he leaves for work, he has to go by the breeding area. I really wanted to be a breeder. They look like they are having fun all day sticking their thing in multiple women. Mommy didn‚Äôt want me to be a breeder though. She said that they live short lives because those in charge pump them full of drugs causing the males to die young. Barely any of them make it to their 30s.
As soon as ACB134 walks past the breeding area, a young male breeder collapses and dies. Well, the cleaners will be called soon, and everyone knows that the male will be turned into food for us to eat.
ACB134 arrives at his workstation.
The manager said, ‚ÄúACB134 you are going to be cleaning up the cleaners‚Äô rooms today. You are free to leave and report to the manager in charge.‚Äù
ACB134, ‚ÄúYes manager, I will report!‚Äù
ACB134 went out into the hallway and the floor began to move, taking him to his location. Once he arrived at his location and checked in, he started to begin cleaning and sharpening the cleaners‚Äô tools. He couldn‚Äôt wait for lunch and to have a human burger. He saw one of the breeders die early this morning, and he was wondering if they would have fresh meat for dinner.
ACB134 said, ‚ÄúWell, all I need to do now is mop this blood up, and lunchtime!‚Äù
As ACB134 began to mop up the blood on the floor, he began to wonder if he would have time to eat a human burger with praying mantis fries before the bombs went off for his escape. He did not know the exact time that the rebels would show up. 
ACB134 thought to himself, well if I don‚Äôt eat, I hope they have some food wherever they stay. I wonder what they eat on the outside. I‚Äôve grown up eating the same thing every day. I hope there is some variety out there‚Äîoutside this cage.
ACB134 finished his duties, cleaned up, and headed to the lunchroom.
Once he arrived, he stood in line until he came up to the lunch robot that handed him his praying mantis fries and human burger. As soon as he sat down an explosion happened. Ten men with guns came rushing in to grab him as they ran out into the desert. ACB134 felt like an hour went by before the rebels took off his mask and he stood at the entrance of the cave.
An old man came out of the cave, ‚ÄúDo you have the stick?‚Äù
ACB134 said, ‚ÄúYes, I have the stick. Is there any way I could get some food?‚Äù
The old man said, ‚ÄúHand me the stick, sit down, I‚Äôm sure we have some goat.‚Äù
ACB134 said, ‚ÄúGoat? You eat goat.‚Äù
The old man replied, ""Yes, we eat goat. What are you used to eating? We have not ever met anyone from The Line.‚Äù
ACB134 replied, ‚ÄúIn The Line, the majority of the food is insects and human workers that die.‚Äù
The old man gave a shocking look on his face and his eyes widened, ‚ÄúThat is sick and horrible. You will not ever eat insects or humans as long as you stay with us. Go ahead and eat and rest. In the morning, when you wake up, we will begin talking about what goes on in The Line and the role that you will play with us helping to destroy those in Power.‚Äù",6,line 15 minute city chapter 1 short story shortstory voice speaker said acb134 wake acb134 said mommy mommy replied yes today date july 6 2052 wake get ready work today big day remember go rebel would like cricket grasshopper crunch breakfast acb134 get bed make grasshopper crunch breakfast acb134 decides take quick shower eats breakfast acb134 get shower put work clothes sits eat breakfast yum grasshopper crunch eats take bowl sink machine clean mommy say forget stick ha plan rebel acb134 reply yes mommy acb134 head door go work maintenance area every time leaf work ha go breeding area really wanted breeder look like fun day sticking thing multiple woman mommy want breeder though said live short life charge pump full drug causing male die young barely make 30 soon acb134 walk past breeding area young male breeder collapse dy well cleaner called soon everyone know male turned food u eat acb134 arrives workstation manager said acb134 going cleaning cleaner room today free leave report manager charge acb134 yes manager report acb134 went hallway floor began move taking location arrived location checked started begin cleaning sharpening cleaner tool wait lunch human burger saw one breeder die early morning wa wondering would fresh meat dinner acb134 said well need mop blood lunchtime acb134 began mop blood floor began wonder would time eat human burger praying mantis fry bomb went escape know exact time rebel would show acb134 thought well eat hope food wherever stay wonder eat outside grown eating thing every day hope variety outside cage acb134 finished duty cleaned headed lunchroom arrived stood line came lunch robot handed praying mantis fry human burger soon sat explosion happened ten men gun came rushing grab ran desert acb134 felt like hour went rebel took mask stood entrance cave old man came cave stick acb134 said yes stick way could get food old man said hand stick sit sure goat acb134 said goat eat goat old man replied yes eat goat used eating ever met anyone line acb134 replied line majority food insect human worker die old man gave shocking look face eye widened sick horrible ever eat insect human long stay u go ahead eat rest morning wake begin talking go line role play u helping destroy power,1.0,0,False,

eFvpHbY7RSE,3,2024-06-16,60 Minute Cities Ottawa (revisited),"A special episode of The Place of Sound podcast featuring highlights from a project I did in 2017 for Bivouac Recordings, in Hong Kong, called 60 minutes Cities Ottawa, a series of winter time field recordings of Ottawa.


Note: This episode is also available in French.


This is a special episode of The Place of Sound (https://www.theplaceofsound.ca/)  podcast.¬†You‚Äôll hear highlights from a project I did in 2017 for¬†Bivouac Recordings (https://bivouacrecording.com/) , a sound label based in Hong Kong, called 60 minutes Cities Ottawa (https://bivouacrecording.com/post/60-minute-cities-ottawa-60fen-zhong-wo-de-cheng-shi-wo-tai-hua)  - featuring winter sounds in Ottawa - curated by Terrence Lloren, which is a series of¬†albums focused on an individual‚Äôs genius loci or the ‚Äòspirit of a place‚Äô.


Each¬†60-minute cities¬†album is a personal document of the recordists (re)discovery of their ‚Äòcity‚Äô through sound. The 60 minutes of recordings are taken from the recordist‚Äôs own personal surroundings and include photos and text to describe the significance of these sounds to their own lives.


The result is a document that reveals the deepest character of a place through a native resident‚Äôs own experience so that (locals) and non-locals, as well as the recordist, can (re)connect with the city and (re)discover the beauty of their place.


You‚Äôll hear excerpts from¬†:

  ‚Ä¢  Commemoration, recorded on November 11, 2016 at 10.58am at the National War Memorial on Elgin Street
  ‚Ä¢  Running, recorded on New Year Day, 2017 at 11.28 am in Sandy Hill
  ‚Ä¢  Protest, recorded on January 21, 2017 at 11am at the corner of Elgin and Gloucester street

TRANSCRIPTION OF EPISODE


Note: below is my original script which I improvised from during the recording


(Choir singing O Canada at Remembrance Day ceremony, November 11, 2016, Ottawa)


Please stand for O Canada‚Ä¶¬†


(Fade to silence)¬†


My name is¬†Claude Schryer. (https://www.claudeschryer.ca/bio/) ¬†Welcome to a special episode of¬†The Place of Sound, (https://www.theplaceofsound.ca/) ¬†a radio show/podcast produced in Carleton University‚Äôs¬†Communication and Media Studies Program (https://carleton.ca/sjc/communication/) ¬†by¬†Dr. Vincent Andrisani (https://www.vincentandrisani.com/) ¬†and airing on¬†CKCU FM (https://www.ckcufm.com/) , campus radio.¬†


The Place of Sound¬†explores the idea of ‚Äòplace‚Äô through the ears of students and sometimes, guest producers, like me. Check it out.¬†


I‚Äôm speaking to you from Ottawa, which is¬†on¬†the unceded and un-surrendered territory of the Algonquin-Anishinaabe nations, who are¬†the customary keepers and defenders of the Ottawa River Watershed and its tributaries.


What you‚Äôll hear today are highlights from a project I did for¬†Bivouac Recordings (https://bivouacrecording.com/) ¬†a sound label based in Hong Kong.¬†In 2017 I produced¬†60 minutes Cities Ottawa (https://bivouacrecording.com/post/60-minute-cities-ottawa-60fen-zhong-wo-de-cheng-shi-wo-tai-hua) ¬†as part of Bivouac‚Äôs 60-minute cities project, curated by Terrence Lloren, which are a series of¬†albums focused on an individual‚Äôs genius loci or the ‚Äòspirit of a place‚Äô, which is closely related to the objectives of this podcast.¬†


Each¬†60-minute cities¬†album is a personal document of the recordists (re)discovery of their ‚Äòcity‚Äô through sound. The 60 minutes of recordings are taken from the recordist‚Äôs own personal surroundings and include photos and text to describe the significance of these sounds to their own lives.

Until September 2020 my day job was as a senior strategic arts advisor at the Canada Council for the Arts but then I decided to focus on the climate emergency and co-founded an art and climate organization called¬†SCALE (https://scale-lesaut.ca/) , the Sectoral Climate Arts Leadership for the Emergency, that I encourage you to check out.¬†


In 2020 I also started up a bilingual podcast called the¬†conscient podcast, balado¬†conscient¬†en fran√ßais, exploring art and the ecological crisis.
