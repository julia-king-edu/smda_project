Research question(s):

This project will investigate the public discourse surrounding the concept of 15-minute cities on YouTube, focusing on the emergence and impact of conspiracy narratives during the COVID-19 pandemic. To track the development of the conspiracy, I aim to obtain metrics on the most-viewed videos pertaining to 15-minute cities per week during the relevant timeframe, classify them and analyze the sentiments expressed in the comments. I will test the following hypotheses:

1. Videos produced before the first spike in public interest are more likely to be non-conspirative compared to those uploaded during and after the spike.

2. Comments under conspirative videos express higher levels of negative sentiment compared to comments under non-conspirative videos.

3. The engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments, shares per view) of conspirative videos differ significantly from those of non-conspirative videos, with conspirative videos having higher engagement rates per view.

Planned data retrieval and analysis to address the questions

I plan the following steps
	
1. Using google trends, determine spikes in public interest concerning 15-minute cities.

2. For the relevant timeframe, obtain the IDs of the most-viewed videos related to 15-minute cities per week.

3. Obtain relevant metadata and comments for the videos.

4. Based on the title and description, classify the a sample of the videos as conspirative or non-conspirative by hand.

5. Employ supervised text analysis to classify the dataset as conspirative or non-conspirative. Evaluate the performance.

6. Use the emotion classification model LEIA to obtain the sentiments expressed in the comments.

7. Conduct statistical analysis to test the hypotheses above.
